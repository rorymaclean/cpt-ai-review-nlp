In the past decade, advances in precision oncology have resulted in an increased 
demand for predictive assays that enable the selection and stratification of 
patients for treatment. The enormous divergence of signalling and 
transcriptional networks mediating the crosstalk between cancer, stromal and 
immune cells complicates the development of functionally relevant biomarkers 
based on a single gene or protein. However, the result of these complex 
processes can be uniquely captured in the morphometric features of stained 
tissue specimens. The possibility of digitizing whole-slide images of tissue has 
led to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools in 
digital pathology, which enable mining of subvisual morphometric phenotypes and 
might, ultimately, improve patient management. In this Perspective, we 
critically evaluate various AI-based computational approaches for digital 
pathology, focusing on deep neural networks and 'hand-crafted' feature-based 
methodologies. We aim to provide a broad framework for incorporating AI and 
machine learning tools into clinical oncology, with an emphasis on biomarker 
development. We discuss some of the challenges relating to the use of AI, 
including the need for well-curated validation datasets, regulatory approval and 
fair reimbursement strategies. Finally, we present potential future 
opportunities for precision oncology.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping cancer research and 
personalized clinical care. Availability of high-dimensionality datasets coupled 
with advances in high-performance computing, as well as innovative deep learning 
architectures, has led to an explosion of AI use in various aspects of oncology 
research. These applications range from detection and classification of cancer, 
to molecular characterization of tumors and their microenvironment, to drug 
discovery and repurposing, to predicting treatment outcomes for patients. As 
these advances start penetrating the clinic, we foresee a shifting paradigm in 
cancer care becoming strongly driven by AI. SIGNIFICANCE: AI has the potential 
to dramatically affect nearly all aspects of oncology-from enhancing diagnosis 
to personalizing treatment and discovering novel anticancer drugs. Here, we 
review the recent enormous progress in the application of AI to oncology, 
highlight limitations and pitfalls, and chart a path for adoption of AI in the 
cancer clinic.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to mimic 
human thought processes, learning capacity, and knowledge storage. AI techniques 
have been applied in cardiovascular medicine to explore novel genotypes and 
phenotypes in existing diseases, improve the quality of patient care, enable 
cost-effectiveness, and reduce readmission and mortality rates. Over the past 
decade, several machine-learning techniques have been used for cardiovascular 
disease diagnosis and prediction. Each problem requires some degree of 
understanding of the problem, in terms of cardiovascular medicine and 
statistics, to apply the optimal machine-learning algorithm. In the near future, 
AI will result in a paradigm shift toward precision cardiovascular medicine. The 
potential of AI in cardiovascular medicine is tremendous; however, ignorance of 
the challenges may overshadow its potential clinical impact. This paper gives a 
glimpse of AI's application in cardiovascular clinical care and discusses its 
potential role in facilitating precision cardiovascular medicine.

A growing body of evidence now suggests that precision psychiatry, an 
interdisciplinary field of psychiatry, precision medicine, and pharmacogenomics, 
serves as an indispensable foundation of medical practices by offering the 
accurate medication with the accurate dose at the accurate time to patients with 
psychiatric disorders. In light of the latest advancements in artificial 
intelligence and machine learning techniques, numerous biomarkers and genetic 
loci associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments are being 
discovered in precision psychiatry research by employing neuroimaging and 
multi-omics. In this review, we focus on the latest developments for precision 
psychiatry research using artificial intelligence and machine learning 
approaches, such as deep learning and neural network algorithms, together with 
multi-omics and neuroimaging data. Firstly, we review precision psychiatry and 
pharmacogenomics studies that leverage various artificial intelligence and 
machine learning techniques to assess treatment prediction, prognosis 
prediction, diagnosis prediction, and the detection of potential biomarkers. In 
addition, we describe potential biomarkers and genetic loci that have been 
discovered to be associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments. 
Moreover, we outline the limitations in regard to the previous precision 
psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies. Finally, we present a discussion of 
directions and challenges for future research.

Precision medicine is an emerging approach to clinical research and patient care 
that focuses on understanding and treating disease by integrating multi-modal or 
multi-omics data from an individual to make patient-tailored decisions. With the 
large and complex datasets generated using precision medicine diagnostic 
approaches, novel techniques to process and understand these complex data were 
needed. At the same time, computer science has progressed rapidly to develop 
techniques that enable the storage, processing, and analysis of these complex 
datasets, a feat that traditional statistics and early computing technologies 
could not accomplish. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is 
a computer science methodology that aims to identify complex patterns in data 
that can be used to make predictions or classifications on new unseen data or 
for advanced exploratory data analysis. Machine learning analysis of precision 
medicine's multi-modal data allows for broad analysis of large datasets and 
ultimately a greater understanding of human health and disease. This review 
focuses on machine learning utilization for precision medicine's "big data", in 
the context of genetics, genomics, and beyond.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have significantly influenced 
many facets of the healthcare sector. Advancement in technology has paved the 
way for analysis of big datasets in a cost- and time-effective manner. Clinical 
oncology and research are reaping the benefits of AI. The burden of cancer is a 
global phenomenon. Efforts to reduce mortality rates requires early diagnosis 
for effective therapeutic interventions. However, metastatic and recurrent 
cancers evolve and acquire drug resistance. It is imperative to detect novel 
biomarkers that induce drug resistance and identify therapeutic targets to 
enhance treatment regimes. The introduction of the next generation sequencing 
(NGS) platforms address these demands, has revolutionised the future of 
precision oncology. NGS offers several clinical applications that are important 
for risk predictor, early detection of disease, diagnosis by sequencing and 
medical imaging, accurate prognosis, biomarker identification and identification 
of therapeutic targets for novel drug discovery. NGS generates large datasets 
that demand specialised bioinformatics resources to analyse the data that is 
relevant and clinically significant. Through these applications of AI, cancer 
diagnostics and prognostic prediction are enhanced with NGS and medical imaging 
that delivers high resolution images. Regardless of the improvements in 
technology, AI has some challenges and limitations, and the clinical application 
of NGS remains to be validated. By continuing to enhance the progression of 
innovation and technology, the future of AI and precision oncology show great 
promise.

Precision Nutrition research aims to use personal information about individuals 
or groups of individuals to deliver nutritional advice that, theoretically, 
would be more suitable than generic advice. Machine learning, a subbranch of 
Artificial Intelligence, has promise to aid in the development of predictive 
models that are suitable for Precision Nutrition. As such, recent research has 
applied machine learning algorithms, tools, and techniques in precision 
nutrition for different purposes. However, a systematic overview of the 
state-of-the-art on the use of machine learning in Precision Nutrition is 
lacking. Therefore, we carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to 
provide an overview of where and how machine learning has been used in Precision 
Nutrition from various aspects, what such machine learning models use as input 
features, what the availability status of the data used in the literature is, 
and how the models are evaluated. Nine research questions were defined in this 
study. We retrieved 4930 papers from electronic databases and 60 primary studies 
were selected to respond to the research questions. All of the selected primary 
studies were also briefly discussed in this article. Our results show that 
fifteen problems spread across seven domains of nutrition and health are 
present. Four machine learning tasks are seen in the form of regression, 
classification, recommendation and clustering, with most of these utilizing a 
supervised approach. In total, 30 algorithms were used, with 19 appearing more 
than once. Models were through the use of four groups of approaches and 23 
evaluation metrics. Personalized approaches are promising to reduce the burden 
of these current problems in nutrition research, and the current review shows 
Machine Learning can be incorporated into Precision Nutrition research with high 
performance. Precision Nutrition researchers should consider incorporating 
Machine Learning into their methods to facilitate the integration of many 
complex features, allowing for the development of high-performance Precision 
Nutrition approaches.

In the era of precision medicine, digital technologies and artificial 
intelligence, drug discovery and development face unprecedented opportunities 
for product and business model innovation, fundamentally changing the 
traditional approach of how drugs are discovered, developed and marketed. 
Critical to this transformation is the adoption of new technologies in the drug 
development process, catalyzing the transition from serendipity-driven to 
data-driven medicine. This paradigm shift comes with a need for both translation 
and precision, leading to a modern Translational Precision Medicine approach to 
drug discovery and development. Key components of Translational Precision 
Medicine are multi-omics profiling, digital biomarkers, model-based data 
integration, artificial intelligence, biomarker-guided trial designs and 
patient-centric companion diagnostics. In this review, we summarize and 
critically discuss the potential and challenges of Translational Precision 
Medicine from a cross-industry perspective.

The number of therapies for heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction 
has nearly doubled in the past decade. In addition, new therapies for HF caused 
by hypertrophic and infiltrative disease are emerging rapidly. Indeed, we are on 
the verge of a new era in HF in which insights into the biology of myocardial 
disease can be matched to an understanding of the genetic predisposition in an 
individual patient to inform precision approaches to therapy. In this Review, we 
summarize the biology of HF, emphasizing the causal relationships between 
genetic contributors and traditional structure-based remodelling outcomes, and 
highlight the mechanisms of action of traditional and novel therapeutics. We 
discuss the latest advances in our understanding of both the Mendelian genetics 
of cardiomyopathy and the complex genetics of the clinical syndrome presenting 
as HF. In the phenotypic domain, we discuss applications of machine learning for 
the subcategorization of HF in ways that might inform rational prescribing of 
medications. We aim to bridge the gap between the biology of the failing heart, 
its diverse clinical presentations and the range of medications that we can now 
use to treat it. We present a roadmap for the future of precision medicine in 
HF.

Pathology is the cornerstone of cancer care. The need for accuracy in 
histopathologic diagnosis of cancer is increasing as personalized cancer therapy 
requires accurate biomarker assessment. The appearance of digital image analysis 
holds promise to improve both the volume and precision of histomorphological 
evaluation. Recently, machine learning, and particularly deep learning, has 
enabled rapid advances in computational pathology. The integration of machine 
learning into routine care will be a milestone for the healthcare sector in the 
next decade, and histopathology is right at the centre of this revolution. 
Examples of potential high-value machine learning applications include both 
model-based assessment of routine diagnostic features in pathology, and the 
ability to extract and identify novel features that provide insights into a 
disease. Recent groundbreaking results have demonstrated that applications of 
machine learning methods in pathology significantly improves metastases 
detection in lymph nodes, Ki67 scoring in breast cancer, Gleason grading in 
prostate cancer and tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) scoring in melanoma. 
Furthermore, deep learning models have also been demonstrated to be able to 
predict status of some molecular markers in lung, prostate, gastric and 
colorectal cancer based on standard HE slides. Moreover, prognostic (survival 
outcomes) deep neural network models based on digitized HE slides have been 
demonstrated in several diseases, including lung cancer, melanoma and glioma. In 
this review, we aim to present and summarize the latest developments in digital 
image analysis and in the application of artificial intelligence in diagnostic 
pathology.

NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4 are transmembrane receptors that transduce 
juxtacrine signals of the delta‑like canonical Notch ligand (DLL)1, DLL3, DLL4, 
jagged canonical Notch ligand (JAG)1 and JAG2. Canonical Notch signaling 
activates the transcription of BMI1 proto‑oncogene polycomb ring finger, cyclin 
D1, CD44, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, hes family bHLH transcription 
factor 1, hes related family bHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1, MYC, 
NOTCH3, RE1 silencing transcription factor and transcription factor 7 in a 
cellular context‑dependent manner, while non‑canonical Notch signaling activates 
NF‑κB and Rac family small GTPase 1. Notch signaling is aberrantly activated in 
breast cancer, non‑small‑cell lung cancer and hematological malignancies, such 
as T‑cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B‑cell lymphoma. 
However, Notch signaling is inactivated in small‑cell lung cancer and squamous 
cell carcinomas. Loss‑of‑function NOTCH1 mutations are early events during 
esophageal tumorigenesis, whereas gain‑of‑function NOTCH1 mutations are late 
events during T‑cell leukemogenesis and B‑cell lymphomagenesis. Notch signaling 
cascades crosstalk with fibroblast growth factor and WNT signaling cascades in 
the tumor microenvironment to maintain cancer stem cells and remodel the tumor 
microenvironment. The Notch signaling network exerts oncogenic and 
tumor‑suppressive effects in a cancer stage‑ or (sub)type‑dependent manner. 
Small‑molecule γ‑secretase inhibitors (AL101, MRK‑560, nirogacestat and others) 
and antibody‑based biologics targeting Notch ligands or receptors [ABT‑165, AMG 
119, rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova‑T) and others] have been developed as 
investigational drugs. The DLL3‑targeting antibody‑drug conjugate (ADC) Rova‑T, 
and DLL3‑targeting chimeric antigen receptor‑modified T cells (CAR‑Ts), AMG 119, 
are promising anti‑cancer therapeutics, as are other ADCs or CAR‑Ts targeting 
tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 17, CD19, CD22, CD30, CD79B, 
CD205, Claudin 18.2, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)2, FGFR3, 
receptor‑type tyrosine‑protein kinase FLT3, HER2, hepatocyte growth factor 
receptor, NECTIN4, inactive tyrosine‑protein kinase 7, inactive tyrosine‑protein 
kinase transmembrane receptor ROR1 and tumor‑associated calcium signal 
transducer 2. ADCs and CAR‑Ts could alter the therapeutic framework for 
refractory cancers, especially diffuse‑type gastric cancer, ovarian cancer and 
pancreatic cancer with peritoneal dissemination. Phase III clinical trials of 
Rova‑T for patients with small‑cell lung cancer and a phase III clinical trial 
of nirogacestat for patients with desmoid tumors are ongoing. Integration of 
human intelligence, cognitive computing and explainable artificial intelligence 
is necessary to construct a Notch‑related knowledge‑base and optimize 
Notch‑targeted therapy for patients with cancer.

Individualizing patient treatment is a core objective of the medical field. 
Reaching this objective has been elusive owing to the complex set of factors 
contributing to both disease and health; many factors, from genes to proteins, 
remain unknown in their role in human physiology. Accurately diagnosing, 
monitoring, and treating disorders requires advances in biomarker discovery, the 
subsequent development of accurate signatures that correspond with dynamic 
disease states, as well as therapeutic interventions that can be continuously 
optimized and modulated for dose and drug selection. This work highlights key 
breakthroughs in the development of enabling technologies that further the goal 
of personalized and precision medicine, and remaining challenges that, when 
addressed, may forge unprecedented capabilities in realizing truly 
individualized patient care.

Medical imaging is the standard-of-care for early detection, diagnosis, 
treatment planning, monitoring, and image-guided interventions of lung cancer 
patients. Most medical images are stored digitally in a standardized Digital 
Imaging and Communications in Medicine format that can be readily accessed and 
used for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Over the several last decades, 
medical images have been shown to contain complementary and interchangeable data 
orthogonal to other sources such as pathology, hematology, genomics, and/or 
proteomics. As such, "radiomics" has emerged as a field of research that 
involves the process of converting standard-of-care images into quantitative 
image-based data that can be merged with other data sources and subsequently 
analyzed using conventional biostatistics or artificial intelligence (AI) 
methods. As radiomic features capture biological and pathophysiological 
information, these quantitative radiomic features have shown to provide rapid 
and accurate noninvasive biomarkers for lung cancer risk prediction, 
diagnostics, prognosis, treatment response monitoring, and tumor biology. In 
this review, radiomics and emerging AI methods in lung cancer research are 
highlighted and discussed including advantages, challenges, and pitfalls.

Metabolic responses to food influence risk of cardiometabolic disease, but 
large-scale high-resolution studies are lacking. We recruited n = 1,002 twins 
and unrelated healthy adults in the United Kingdom to the PREDICT 1 study and 
assessed postprandial metabolic responses in a clinical setting and at home. We 
observed large inter-individual variability (as measured by the population 
coefficient of variation (s.d./mean, %)) in postprandial responses of blood 
triglyceride (103%), glucose (68%) and insulin (59%) following identical meals. 
Person-specific factors, such as gut microbiome, had a greater influence (7.1% 
of variance) than did meal macronutrients (3.6%) for postprandial lipemia, but 
not for postprandial glycemia (6.0% and 15.4%, respectively); genetic variants 
had a modest impact on predictions (9.5% for glucose, 0.8% for triglyceride, 
0.2% for C-peptide). Findings were independently validated in a US cohort 
(n = 100 people). We developed a machine-learning model that predicted both 
triglyceride (r = 0.47) and glycemic (r = 0.77) responses to food intake. These 
findings may be informative for developing personalized diet strategies. The 
ClinicalTrials.gov registration identifier is NCT03479866.

Medical imaging can assess the tumor and its environment in their entirety, 
which makes it suitable for monitoring the temporal and spatial characteristics 
of the tumor. Progress in computational methods, especially in artificial 
intelligence for medical image process and analysis, has converted these images 
into quantitative and minable data associated with clinical events in oncology 
management. This concept was first described as radiomics in 2012. Since then, 
computer scientists, radiologists, and oncologists have gravitated towards this 
new tool and exploited advanced methodologies to mine the information behind 
medical images. On the basis of a great quantity of radiographic images and 
novel computational technologies, researchers developed and validated radiomic 
models that may improve the accuracy of diagnoses and therapy response 
assessments. Here, we review the recent methodological developments in 
radiomics, including data acquisition, tumor segmentation, feature extraction, 
and modelling, as well as the rapidly developing deep learning technology. 
Moreover, we outline the main applications of radiomics in diagnosis, treatment 
planning and evaluations in the field of oncology with the aim of developing 
quantitative and personalized medicine. Finally, we discuss the challenges in 
the field of radiomics and the scope and clinical applicability of these 
methods.

The gut microbiome has been implicated in cancer in several ways, as specific 
microbial signatures are known to promote cancer development and influence 
safety, tolerability and efficacy of therapies. The 'omics' technologies used 
for microbiome analysis continuously evolve and, although much of the research 
is still at an early stage, large-scale datasets of ever increasing size and 
complexity are being produced. However, there are varying levels of difficulty 
in realizing the full potential of these new tools, which limit our ability to 
critically analyse much of the available data. In this Perspective, we provide a 
brief overview on the role of gut microbiome in cancer and focus on the need, 
role and limitations of a machine learning-driven approach to analyse large 
amounts of complex health-care information in the era of big data. We also 
discuss the potential application of microbiome-based big data aimed at 
promoting precision medicine in cancer.

Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has contributed substantially 
to the resolution of various medical problems, including cancer. Deep learning 
(DL), a subfield of AI, is characterized by its ability to perform automated 
feature extraction and has great power in the assimilation and evaluation of 
large amounts of complicated data. On the basis of a large quantity of medical 
data and novel computational technologies, AI, especially DL, has been applied 
in various aspects of oncology research and has the potential to enhance cancer 
diagnosis and treatment. These applications range from early cancer detection, 
diagnosis, classification and grading, molecular characterization of tumors, 
prediction of patient outcomes and treatment responses, personalized treatment, 
automatic radiotherapy workflows, novel anti-cancer drug discovery, and clinical 
trials. In this review, we introduced the general principle of AI, summarized 
major areas of its application for cancer diagnosis and treatment, and discussed 
its future directions and remaining challenges. As the adoption of AI in 
clinical use is increasing, we anticipate the arrival of AI-powered cancer care.

Aberrant metabolism is the root cause of several serious health issues, creating 
a huge burden to health and leading to diminished life expectancy. A 
dysregulated metabolism induces the secretion of several molecules which in turn 
trigger the inflammatory pathway. Inflammation is the natural reaction of the 
immune system to a variety of stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, and 
harmful substances. Metabolically triggered inflammation, also called 
metaflammation or low-grade chronic inflammation, is the consequence of a 
synergic interaction between the host and the exposome-a combination of 
environmental drivers, including diet, lifestyle, pollutants and other factors 
throughout the life span of an individual. Various levels of chronic 
inflammation are associated with several lifestyle-related diseases such as 
diabetes, obesity, metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), cancers, 
cardiovascular disorders (CVDs), autoimmune diseases, and chronic lung diseases. 
Chronic diseases are a growing concern worldwide, placing a heavy burden on 
individuals, families, governments, and health-care systems. New strategies are 
needed to empower communities worldwide to prevent and treat these diseases. 
Precision medicine provides a model for the next generation of lifestyle 
modification. This will capitalize on the dynamic interaction between an 
individual's biology, lifestyle, behavior, and environment. The aim of precision 
medicine is to design and improve diagnosis, therapeutics and prognostication 
through the use of large complex datasets that incorporate individual gene, 
function, and environmental variations. The implementation of high-performance 
computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) can predict risks with greater 
accuracy based on available multidimensional clinical and biological datasets. 
AI-powered precision medicine provides clinicians with an opportunity to 
specifically tailor early interventions to each individual. In this article, we 
discuss the strengths and limitations of existing and evolving recent, 
data-driven technologies, such as AI, in preventing, treating and reversing 
lifestyle-related diseases.

Advances in quantitative biomarker development have accelerated new forms of 
data-driven insights for patients with cancer. However, most approaches are 
limited to a single mode of data, leaving integrated approaches across 
modalities relatively underdeveloped. Multimodal integration of advanced 
molecular diagnostics, radiological and histological imaging, and codified 
clinical data presents opportunities to advance precision oncology beyond 
genomics and standard molecular techniques. However, most medical datasets are 
still too sparse to be useful for the training of modern machine learning 
techniques, and significant challenges remain before this is remedied. Combined 
efforts of data engineering, computational methods for analysis of heterogeneous 
data and instantiation of synergistic data models in biomedical research are 
required for success. In this Perspective, we offer our opinions on synthesizing 
complementary modalities of data with emerging multimodal artificial 
intelligence methods. Advancing along this direction will result in a reimagined 
class of multimodal biomarkers to propel the field of precision oncology in the 
coming decade.

Allergic diseases (atopic dermatitis, food allergy, eosinophilic esophagitis, 
asthma and allergic rhinitis), perhaps more than many other traditionally 
grouped disorders, share several overlapping inflammatory pathways and risk 
factors, though we are still beginning to understand how the relevant patient 
and environmental factors uniquely shape each disease. Precision medicine is the 
concept of applying multiple levels of patient-specific data to tailor diagnoses 
and available treatments to the individual; ideally, a patient receives the 
right intervention at the right time, in order to maximize effectiveness but 
minimize morbidity, mortality and cost. While precision medicine in allergy is 
in its infancy, the recent success of biologics, development of tools focused on 
large data set integration and improved sampling methods are encouraging and 
demonstrates the utility of refining our understanding of allergic endotypes to 
improve therapies. Some of the biggest challenges to achieving precision 
medicine in allergy are characterizing allergic endotypes, understanding 
allergic multimorbidity relationships, contextualizing the impact of 
environmental exposures (the "exposome") and ancestry/genetic risks, achieving 
actionable multi-omics integration, and using this information to develop 
adequately powered patient cohorts and refined clinical trials. In this paper, 
we highlight several recently developed tools and methods showing promise to 
realize the aspirational potential of precision medicine in allergic disease. We 
also outline current challenges, including exposome sampling and building the 
"knowledge network" with multi-omics integration.

The nature of mental illness remains a conundrum. Traditional disease categories 
are increasingly suspected to misrepresent the causes underlying mental 
disturbance. Yet psychiatrists and investigators now have an unprecedented 
opportunity to benefit from complex patterns in brain, behavior, and genes using 
methods from machine learning (e.g., support vector machines, modern 
neural-network algorithms, cross-validation procedures). Combining these 
analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has 
the potential to advance a biologically grounded redefinition of major 
psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that data-derived subgroups 
of psychiatric patients can better predict treatment outcomes than DSM/ICD 
diagnoses can. In a new era of evidence-based psychiatry tailored to single 
patients, objectively measurable endophenotypes could allow for early disease 
detection, individualized treatment selection, and dosage adjustment to reduce 
the burden of disease. This primer aims to introduce clinicians and researchers 
to the opportunities and challenges in bringing machine intelligence into 
psychiatric practice.

Artificial Intelligence revolutionizes the drug development process that can 
quickly identify potential biologically active compounds from millions of 
candidate within a short period. The present review is an overview based on some 
applications of Machine Learning based tools, such as GOLD, Deep PVP, LIB SVM, 
etc. and the algorithms involved such as support vector machine (SVM), random 
forest (RF), decision tree and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), etc. at various 
stages of drug designing and development. These techniques can be employed in 
SNP discoveries, drug repurposing, ligand-based drug design (LBDD), Ligand-based 
Virtual Screening (LBVS) and Structure- based Virtual Screening (SBVS), Lead 
identification, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, 
and ADMET analysis. It is demonstrated that SVM exhibited better performance in 
indicating that the classification model will have great applications on human 
intestinal absorption (HIA) predictions. Successful cases have been reported 
which demonstrate the efficiency of SVM and RF models in identifying JFD00950 as 
a novel compound targeting against a colon cancer cell line, DLD-1, by 
inhibition of FEN1 cytotoxic and cleavage activity. Furthermore, a QSAR model 
was also used to predict flavonoid inhibitory effects on AR activity as a potent 
treatment for diabetes mellitus (DM), using ANN. Hence, in the era of big data, 
ML approaches have been evolved as a powerful and efficient way to deal with the 
huge amounts of generated data from modern drug discovery to model 
small-molecule drugs, gene biomarkers and identifying the novel drug targets for 
various diseases.

There is currently no approved treatment for primary Sjögren's syndrome, a 
disease that primarily affects adult women. The difficulty in developing 
effective therapies is -in part- because of the heterogeneity in the clinical 
manifestation and pathophysiology of the disease. Finding common molecular 
signatures among patient subgroups could improve our understanding of disease 
etiology, and facilitate the development of targeted therapeutics. Here, we 
report, in a cross-sectional cohort, a molecular classification scheme for 
Sjögren's syndrome patients based on the multi-omic profiling of whole blood 
samples from a European cohort of over 300 patients, and a similar number of age 
and gender-matched healthy volunteers. Using transcriptomic, genomic, 
epigenetic, cytokine expression and flow cytometry data, combined with clinical 
parameters, we identify four groups of patients with distinct patterns of immune 
dysregulation. The biomarkers we identify can be used by machine learning 
classifiers to sort future patients into subgroups, allowing the re-evaluation 
of response to treatments in clinical trials.

Cancer is a complex genetic disease that develops from the accumulation of 
genomic alterations in which germline variations predispose individuals to 
cancer and somatic alterations initiate and trigger the progression of cancer. 
For the past 2 decades, genomic research has advanced remarkably, evolving from 
single-gene to whole-genome screening by using genome-wide association study and 
next-generation sequencing that contributes to big genomic data. International 
collaborative efforts have contributed to curating these data to identify 
clinically significant alterations that could be used in clinical settings. 
Focusing on breast cancer, the present review summarizes the identification of 
genomic alterations with high-throughput screening as well as the use of genomic 
information in clinical trials that match cancer patients to therapies, which 
further leads to cancer precision medicine. Furthermore, cancer screening and 
monitoring were enhanced greatly by the use of liquid biopsies. With the growing 
data complexity and size, there is much anticipation in exploiting deep machine 
learning and artificial intelligence to curate integrative "-omics" data to 
refine the current medical practice to be applied in the near future.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Transplant pathology contributes substantially to 
personalized treatment of organ allograft recipients. Rapidly advancing 
next-generation human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sequencing and pathology are 
enhancing the abilities to improve donor/recipient matching and allograft 
monitoring.
RECENT FINDINGS: The present review summarizes the workflow of a prototypical 
patient through a pathology practice, highlighting histocompatibility assessment 
and pathologic review of tissues as areas that are evolving to incorporate 
next-generation technologies while emphasizing critical needs of the field.
SUMMARY: Successful organ transplantation starts with the most precise pratical 
donor-recipient histocompatibility matching. Next-generation sequencing provides 
the highest resolution donor-recipient matching and enables eplet mismatch 
scores and more precise monitoring of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) that may 
arise after transplant. Multiplex labeling combined with hand-crafted machine 
learning is transforming traditional histopathology. The combination of 
traditional blood/body fluid laboratory tests, eplet and DSA analysis, 
traditional and next-generation histopathology, and -omics-based platforms 
enables risk stratification and identification of early subclinical 
molecular-based changes that precede a decline in allograft function. Needs 
include software integration of data derived from diverse platforms that can 
render the most accurate assessment of allograft health and needs for 
immunosuppression adjustments.

Traditionally, new treatments have been developed for the population at large. 
Recently, large-scale genomic sequencing analyses have revealed tremendous 
genetic diversity between individuals. In diseases driven by genetic events such 
as cancer, genomic sequencing can unravel all the mutations that drive 
individual tumors. The ability to capture the genetic makeup of individual 
patients has led to the concept of precision medicine, a modern, 
technology-driven form of personalized medicine. Precision medicine matches each 
individual to the best treatment in a way that is tailored to his or her genetic 
uniqueness. To further personalize medicine, precision medicine increasingly 
incorporates and integrates data beyond genomics, such as epigenomics and 
metabolomics, as well as imaging. Increasingly, the robust use and integration 
of these modalities in precision medicine require the use of artificial 
intelligence and machine learning. This modern view of precision medicine, 
adopted early in certain areas of medicine such as cancer, has started to impact 
the field of reproductive medicine. Here we review the concepts and history of 
precision medicine and artificial intelligence, highlight their growing impact 
on reproductive medicine, and outline some of the challenges and limitations 
that these new fields have encountered in medicine.

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and precision medicine promises 
to revolutionize health care. Precision medicine methods identify phenotypes of 
patients with less-common responses to treatment or unique healthcare needs. AI 
leverages sophisticated computation and inference to generate insights, enables 
the system to reason and learn, and empowers clinician decision making through 
augmented intelligence. Recent literature suggests that translational research 
exploring this convergence will help solve the most difficult challenges facing 
precision medicine, especially those in which nongenomic and genomic 
determinants, combined with information from patient symptoms, clinical history, 
and lifestyles, will facilitate personalized diagnosis and prognostication.

As machine learning (ML) and precision medicine become more readily available 
and used in practice, emergency physicians must understand the potential 
advantages and limitations of the technology. This narrative review focuses on 
the key components of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and precision 
medicine in emergency medicine (EM). Based on the content expertise, we 
identified articles from EM literature. The authors provided a narrative summary 
of each piece of literature. Next, the authors provided an introduction of the 
concepts of ML, artificial intelligence as an extension of ML, and precision 
medicine. This was followed by concrete examples of their applications in 
practice and research. Subsequently, we shared our thoughts on how to consume 
the existing research in these subjects and conduct high-quality research for 
academic emergency medicine. We foresee that the EM community will continue to 
adapt machine learning, artificial intelligence, and precision medicine in 
research and practice. We described several key components using our expertise.

Clinical success of immunotherapy is driving the need for new prognostic and 
predictive assays to inform patient selection and stratification. This 
requirement can be met by a combination of computational pathology and 
artificial intelligence. Here, we critically assess computational approaches 
supporting the development of a standardized methodology in the assessment of 
immune-oncology biomarkers, such as PD-L1 and immune cell infiltrates. We 
examine immunoprofiling through spatial analysis of tumor-immune cell 
interactions and multiplexing technologies as a predictor of patient response to 
cancer treatment. Further, we discuss how integrated bioinformatics can enable 
the amalgamation of complex morphological phenotypes with the multiomics 
datasets that drive precision medicine. We provide an outline to machine 
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence tools and illustrate fields of 
application in immune-oncology, such as pattern-recognition in large and complex 
datasets and deep learning approaches for survival analysis. Synergies of 
surgical pathology and computational analyses are expected to improve patient 
stratification in immuno-oncology. We propose that future clinical demands will 
be best met by (1) dedicated research at the interface of pathology and 
bioinformatics, supported by professional societies, and (2) the integration of 
data sciences and digital image analysis in the professional education of 
pathologists.

The advancement of investigation tools and electronic health records (EHR) 
enables a paradigm shift from guideline-specific therapy toward patient-specific 
precision medicine. The multiparametric and large detailed information 
necessitates novel analyses to explore the insight of diseases and to aid the 
diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI), 
machine learning, and deep learning (DL) provide various models of supervised, 
or unsupervised algorithms, and sophisticated neural networks to generate 
predictive models more precisely than conventional ones. The data, application 
tasks, and algorithms are three key components in AI. Various data formats are 
available in daily clinical practice of hepatology, including radiological 
imaging, EHR, liver pathology, data from wearable devices, and multi-omics 
measurements. The images of abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and 
magnetic resonance imaging can be used to predict liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and differentiation of benign tumors 
from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using EHR, the AI algorithms help predict 
the diagnosis and outcomes of liver cirrhosis, HCC, NAFLD, portal hypertension, 
varices, liver transplantation, and acute liver failure. AI helps to predict 
severity and patterns of fibrosis, steatosis, activity of NAFLD, and survival of 
HCC by using pathological data. Despite of these high potentials of AI 
application, data preparation, collection, quality, labeling, and sampling 
biases of data are major concerns. The selection, evaluation, and validation of 
algorithms, as well as real-world application of these AI models, are also 
challenging. Nevertheless, AI opens the new era of precision medicine in 
hepatology, which will change our future practice.

The treatment of depression represents a major challenge for healthcare systems 
and choosing among the many available drugs without objective guidance criteria 
is an error-prone process. Recently, pharmacogenetic biomarkers entered in 
prescribing guidelines, giving clinicians the possibility to use this additional 
tool to guide prescription and improve therapeutic outcomes. This marked an 
important step towards precision psychiatry, which aim is to integrate 
biological and environmental information to personalise treatments. Only genetic 
variants in cytochrome enzymes are endorsed by prescribing guidelines, but in 
the future polygenic predictors of treatment outcomes may be translated into the 
clinic. The integration of genetics with other relevant information (e.g., 
concomitant diseases and treatments, drug plasma levels) could be managed in a 
standardised way through ad hoc software. The overcoming of the current 
obstacles (e.g., staff training, genotyping and informatics facilities) can lead 
to a broad implementation of precision psychiatry and represent a revolution for 
psychiatric care.Key pointsPrecision psychiatry aims to integrate biological and 
environmental information to personalise treatments and complement clinical 
judgementPharmacogenetic biomarkers in cytochrome genes were included in 
prescribing guidelines and represented an important step towards precision 
psychiatryTherapeutic drug monitoring is an important and cost-effective tool 
which should be integrated with genetic testing and clinical evaluation in order 
to optimise pharmacotherapyOther individual factors relevant to pharmacotherapy 
response (e.g., individual's symptom profile, concomitant diseases) can be 
integrated with genetic information through artificial intelligence to provide 
treatment recommendationsThe creation of pharmacogenetic services within 
healthcare systems is a challenging and multi-step process, education of health 
professionals, promotion by institutions and regulatory bodies, economic and 
ethical barriers are the main issues.

The advancement of precision medicine in medical care has led behind the 
conventional symptom-driven treatment process by allowing early risk prediction 
of disease through improved diagnostics and customization of more effective 
treatments. It is necessary to scrutinize overall patient data alongside broad 
factors to observe and differentiate between ill and relatively healthy people 
to take the most appropriate path toward precision medicine, resulting in an 
improved vision of biological indicators that can signal health changes. 
Precision and genomic medicine combined with artificial intelligence have the 
potential to improve patient healthcare. Patients with less common therapeutic 
responses or unique healthcare demands are using genomic medicine technologies. 
AI provides insights through advanced computation and inference, enabling the 
system to reason and learn while enhancing physician decision making. Many cell 
characteristics, including gene up-regulation, proteins binding to nucleic 
acids, and splicing, can be measured at high throughput and used as training 
objectives for predictive models. Researchers can create a new era of effective 
genomic medicine with the improved availability of a broad range of datasets and 
modern computer techniques such as machine learning. This review article has 
elucidated the contributions of ML algorithms in precision and genome medicine.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We describe and contrast the strengths of precision medicine 
with Western medicine, and complex trait genetics with Mendelian genetics. 
Classic genetics focuses on highly penetrant pathogenic variants in a single 
gene believed to cause or confer a high risk for well-defined phenotypes. 
However, a minority of disorders have a single gene cause. Further, even 
individuals with identical Mendelian disease-associated genotypes may exhibit 
substantial phenotypic variability indicative of genetic and environmental 
modifiers. Still, most diseases are considered complex traits (or complex 
diseases).
RECENT FINDINGS: New insights into the genetic underpinnings of complex traits 
provide opportunities for advances in diagnosis and management. Precision 
medicine provides the framework for integrating complex trait knowledge into 
clinical care through a sophisticated analysis pipeline. Multidimensional 
modeling of acquired diseases includes multiple genetic risks scattered over 
many genes and gene regulators that must be interpreted on the basis of 
functional evidence (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics) with structured models and 
expert systems; strengthened with machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
The choice of genotyping approaches (shotgun sequencing, single nucleotide 
polymorphism chips, targeted panels) is discussed.
SUMMARY: The result of a good precision medicine tool is clinical-decision

Vaccination is one of the most important innovations in human history. It has 
also become a hot research area in a new application - the development of new 
vaccines against non-infectious diseases such as cancers. However, effective and 
safe vaccines still do not exist for many diseases, and where vaccines exist, 
their protective immune mechanisms are often unclear. Although licensed vaccines 
are generally safe, various adverse events, and sometimes severe adverse events, 
still exist for a small population. Precision medicine tailors medical 
intervention to the personal characteristics of individual patients or 
sub-populations of individuals with similar immunity-related characteristics. 
Precision vaccinology is a new strategy that applies precision medicine to the 
development, administration, and post-administration analysis of vaccines. 
Several conditions contribute to make this the right time to embark on the 
development of precision vaccinology. First, the increased level of research in 
vaccinology has generated voluminous "big data" repositories of vaccinology 
data. Secondly, new technologies such as multi-omics and immunoinformatics bring 
new methods for investigating vaccines and immunology. Finally, the advent of AI 
and machine learning software now makes possible the marriage of Big Data to the 
development of new vaccines in ways not possible before. However, something is 
missing in this marriage, and that is a common language that facilitates the 
correlation, analysis, and reporting nomenclature for the field of vaccinology. 
Solving this bioinformatics problem is the domain of applied biomedical 
ontology. Ontology in the informatics field is human- and machine-interpretable 
representation of entities and the relations among entities in a specific 
domain. The Vaccine Ontology (VO) and Ontology of Vaccine Adverse Events (OVAE) 
have been developed to support the standard representation of vaccines, vaccine 
components, vaccinations, host responses, and vaccine adverse events. Many other 
biomedical ontologies have also been developed and can be applied in vaccine 
research. Here, we review the current status of precision vaccinology and how 
ontological development will enhance this field, and propose an ontology-based 
precision vaccinology strategy to support precision vaccine research and 
development.

The rise of omics techniques has resulted in an explosion of molecular data in 
modern biomedical research. Together with information from medical images and 
clinical data, the field of omics has driven the implementation of personalized 
medicine. Biomedical and omics datasets are complex and heterogeneous, and 
extracting meaningful knowledge from this vast amount of information is by far 
the most important challenge for bioinformatics and machine learning 
researchers. In this context, there is an increasing interest in the potential 
of deep learning (DL) methods to create predictive models and to identify 
complex patterns from these large datasets. This chapter provides an overview of 
the main applications of DL methods in biomedical research, with focus on omics 
data analysis and precision medicine applications. DL algorithms and the most 
popular architectures are introduced first. This is followed by a review of some 
of the main applications and problems approached by DL in omics data and medical 
image analysis. Finally, implementations for improving the diagnosis, treatment, 
and classification of complex diseases are discussed.

As individuals seek increasingly individualised nutrition and lifestyle 
guidance, numerous apps and nutrition programmes have emerged. However, complex 
individual variations in dietary behaviours, genotypes, gene expression and 
composition of the microbiome are increasingly recognised. Advances in digital 
tools and artificial intelligence can help individuals more easily track 
nutrient intakes and identify nutritional gaps. However, the influence of these 
nutrients on health outcomes can vary widely among individuals depending upon 
life stage, genetics and microbial composition. For example, folate may elicit 
favourable epigenetic effects on brain development during a critical 
developmental time window of pregnancy. Genes affecting vitamin B12 metabolism 
may lead to cardiometabolic traits that play an essential role in the context of 
obesity. Finally, an individual's gut microbial composition can determine their 
response to dietary fibre interventions during weight loss. These recent 
advances in understanding can lead to a more complete and integrated approach to 
promoting optimal health through personalised nutrition, in clinical practice 
settings and for individuals in their daily lives. The purpose of this review is 
to summarise presentations made during the DSM Science and Technology Award 
Symposium at the 13th European Nutrition Conference, which focused on 
personalised nutrition and novel technologies for health in the modern world.

The risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) clinical manifestations and patient 
management is estimated according to risk scores accounting multifactorial risk 
factors, thus failing to cover the individual cardiovascular risk. Technological 
improvements in the field of medical imaging, in particular, in cardiac computed 
tomography angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance protocols, laid the 
development of radiogenomics. Radiogenomics aims to integrate a huge number of 
imaging features and molecular profiles to identify optimal radiomic/biomarker 
signatures. In addition, supervised and unsupervised artificial intelligence 
algorithms have the potential to combine different layers of data (imaging 
parameters and features, clinical variables and biomarkers) and elaborate 
complex and specific CHD risk models allowing more accurate diagnosis and 
reliable prognosis prediction. Literature from the past 5 years was 
systematically collected from PubMed and Scopus databases, and 60 studies were 
selected. We speculated the applicability of radiogenomics and artificial 
intelligence through the application of machine learning algorithms to identify 
CHD and characterize atherosclerotic lesions and myocardial abnormalities. 
Radiomic features extracted by cardiac computed tomography angiography and 
cardiac magnetic resonance showed good diagnostic accuracy for the 
identification of coronary plaques and myocardium structure; on the other hand, 
few studies exploited radiogenomics integration, thus suggesting further 
research efforts in this field. Cardiac computed tomography angiography resulted 
the most used noninvasive imaging modality for artificial intelligence 
applications. Several studies provided high performance for CHD diagnosis, 
classification, and prognostic assessment even though several efforts are still 
needed to validate and standardize algorithms for CHD patient routine according 
to good medical practice.

The discipline of radiology and diagnostic imaging has evolved greatly in recent 
years. We have observed an exponential increase in the number of exams 
performed, subspecialization of medical fields, and increases in accuracy of the 
various imaging methods, making it a challenge for the radiologist to "know 
everything about all exams and regions". In addition, imaging exams are no 
longer only qualitative and diagnostic, providing now quantitative information 
on disease severity, as well as identifying biomarkers of prognosis and 
treatment response. In view of this, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been 
developed with the objective of complementing diagnostic imaging and helping the 
therapeutic decision-making process. With the advent of artificial intelligence, 
"big data", and machine learning, we are moving toward the rapid expansion of 
the use of these tools in daily life of physicians, making each patient unique, 
as well as leading radiology toward the concept of multidisciplinary approach 
and precision medicine. In this article, we will present the main aspects of the 
computational tools currently available for analysis of images and the 
principles of such analysis, together with the main terms and concepts involved, 
as well as examining the impact that the development of artificial intelligence 
has had on radiology and diagnostic imaging.

Learning and environmental adaptation increase the likelihood of survival and 
improve the quality of life. However, it is often difficult to judge optimal 
behaviors in real life due to highly complex social dynamics and environment. 
Consequentially, many different brain regions and neuronal circuits are involved 
in decision-making. Many neurobiological studies on decision-making show that 
behaviors are chosen through coordination among multiple neural network systems, 
each implementing a distinct set of computational algorithms. Although these 
processes are commonly abnormal in neurological and psychiatric disorders, the 
underlying causes remain incompletely elucidated. Machine learning approaches 
with multidimensional data sets have the potential to not only pathologically 
redefine mental illnesses but also better improve therapeutic outcomes than 
DSM/ICD diagnoses. Furthermore, measurable endophenotypes could allow for early 
disease detection, prognosis, and optimal treatment regime for individuals. In 
this review, decision-making in real life and psychiatric disorders and the 
applications of machine learning in brain imaging studies on psychiatric 
disorders are summarized, and considerations for the future clinical translation 
are outlined. This review also aims to introduce clinicians, scientists, and 
engineers to the opportunities and challenges in bringing artificial 
intelligence into psychiatric practice.

Precision medicine is the new age medicine and refers to tailoring treatments to 
a subpopulation who have a common susceptibility to a particular disease or 
similar response to a particular drug. Although the concept existed even during 
the times of Sir William Osler, it was given a shot in the arm with the 
Precision Medicine Initiative launched by Barack Obama in 2015. The main tools 
of precision medicine are Big data, artificial intelligence, the various omics, 
pharmaco-omics, environmental and social factors and the integration of these 
with preventive and population medicine. Big data can be acquired from 
electronic health records of patients and includes various biomarkers (clinical 
and omics based), laboratory and radiological investigations and these can be 
analysed through machine learning by various complex flowcharts setting up an 
algorithm for the management of specific subpopulations. So, there is a move 
away from the traditional "one size fits all" treatment to precision-based 
medicine. Research in "omics" has increased in leaps and bounds and advancements 
have included the fields of genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, 
metabolomics and microbiomics. Pharmaco-omics has also come to the forefront 
with development of new drugs and suiting a particular drug to a particular 
subpopulation, thus avoiding their prescription to non-responders, preventing 
unwanted adverse effects and proving economical in the long run. Environmental, 
social and behavioural factors are as important or in fact more important than 
genetic factors in most complex diseases and managing these factors form an 
important part of precision medicine. Finally integrating precision with 
preventive and public health makes "precision medicine" a complete final product 
which will change the way medicine will be practised in future.

The early identification of pathogenic mechanisms is essential to predict the 
incidence and progression of cardiomyopathies and to plan appropriate preventive 
interventions. Noninvasive cardiac imaging such as cardiac computed tomography, 
cardiac magnetic resonance, and nuclear imaging plays an important role in 
diagnosis and management of cardiomyopathies and provides useful prognostic 
information. Most molecular factors exert their functions by interacting with 
other cellular components, thus many diseases reflect perturbations of 
intracellular networks. Indeed, complex diseases and traits such as 
cardiomyopathies are caused by perturbations of biological networks. The network 
medicine approach, by integrating systems biology, aims to identify pathological 
interacting genes and proteins, revolutionizing the way to know cardiomyopathies 
and shifting the understanding of their pathogenic phenomena from a reductionist 
to a holistic approach. In addition, artificial intelligence tools, applied to 
morphological and functional imaging, could allow imaging scans to be 
automatically analyzed to extract new parameters and features for cardiomyopathy 
evaluation. The aim of this review is to discuss the tools of network medicine 
in cardiomyopathies that could reveal new candidate genes and artificial 
intelligence imaging-based features with the aim to translate into clinical 
practice as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers and shed new light 
on the clinical setting of cardiomyopathies. The integration and elaboration of 
clinical habits, molecular big data, and imaging into machine learning models 
could provide better disease phenotyping, outcome prediction, and novel drug 
targets, thus opening a new scenario for the implementation of precision 
medicine for cardiomyopathies.

With the development of genomics, the update of modern imaging technology and 
the advent of artificial intelligence and big data, the surgical treatment of 
gastric cancer has gradually stepped into precision medicine. Precision surgery 
treatment of gastric cancer is based on accurate molecular typing and staging 
using modern molecular diagnostic technology and imaging, and the formulation of 
precise and individualized surgical treatment plans, with the concept of 
minimally invasive and accelerated rehabilitation surgery running through it. 
For intermediate-stage gastric cancer, we have adopted a comprehensive treatment 
approach including traditional radiotherapy and chemotherapy, targeted therapy 
and immunotherapy. Utilize artificial intelligence and big data technology to 
improve the standardization and interconnectivity of specialty data and realize 
the transformation of evidence-based medicine. Promoting the standardization, 
standardization and individualization of gastric cancer surgical treatment, 
providing patients with precise diagnosis and treatment, and further improving 
patients' prognosis are the opportunities and challenges in the development of 
gastric cancer surgery.

Periodontitis is among the most common health conditions and represents a major 
public health issue related to increasing prevalence and seriously negative 
socioeconomic impacts. Periodontitis-associated low-grade systemic inflammation 
and its pathological interplay with systemic conditions additionally raises 
awareness on the necessity for highly performant strategies for the prevention 
and management of periodontitis. Periodontal diagnosis is the backbone of a 
successful periodontal strategy, since prevention and treatment plans depend on 
the accuracy and precision of the respective diagnostics. Periodontal 
diagnostics is still founded on clinical and radiological parameters that 
provide limited therapeutic guidance due to the multifactorial complexity of 
periodontal pathology, which is why biomarkers have been introduced for the 
first time in the new classification of periodontal and peri-implant conditions 
as a first step towards precision periodontics. Since the driving forces of 
precision medicine are represented by biomarkers and machine learning 
algorithms, with the lack of periodontal markers validated for diagnostic use, 
the implementation of a precision medicine approach in periodontology remains in 
the very initial stage. This narrative review elaborates the unmet diagnostic 
needs in periodontal diagnostics, the concept of precision periodontics, 
periodontal biomarkers, and a roadmap toward the implementation of a precision 
medicine approach in periodontal practice.

Introduction: Precision medicine is the concept of treating diseases based on 
environmental factors, lifestyles, and molecular profiles of patients. This 
approach has been found to increase success rates of clinical trials and 
accelerate drug approvals. However, current precision medicine applications in 
early drug discovery use only a handful of molecular biomarkers to make 
decisions, whilst clinics gear up to capture the full molecular landscape of 
patients in the near future. This deep multi-omics characterization demands new 
analysis strategies to identify appropriate treatment regimens, which we 
envision will be pioneered by artificial intelligence.Areas covered: In this 
review, the authors discuss the current state of drug discovery in precision 
medicine and present our vision of how artificial intelligence will impact 
biomarker discovery and drug design.Expert opinion: Precision medicine is 
expected to revolutionize modern medicine; however, its traditional form is 
focusing on a few biomarkers, thus not equipped to leverage the full power of 
molecular landscapes. For learning how the development of drugs can be tailored 
to the heterogeneity of patients across their molecular profiles, artificial 
intelligence algorithms are the next frontier in precision medicine and will 
enable a fully personalized approach in drug design, and thus ultimately 
impacting clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: The radiological reading room is undergoing a paradigm shift to a 
symbiosis of computer science and radiology using artificial intelligence 
integrated with machine and deep learning with radiomics to better define tissue 
characteristics. The goal is to use integrated deep learning and radiomics with 
radiological parameters to produce a personalized diagnosis for a patient.
AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of historical and current deep 
learning and radiomics methods in the context of precision medicine in 
radiology. A literature search for 'Deep Learning', 'Radiomics', 'Machine 
learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 
'Generative Adversarial Network', 'Autoencoders', Deep Belief Networks", 
Reinforcement Learning", and 'Multiparametric MRI' was performed in PubMed, 
ArXiv, Scopus, CVPR, SPIE, IEEE Xplore, and NIPS to identify articles of 
interest.
EXPERT OPINION: In conclusion, both deep learning and radiomics are two rapidly 
advancing technologies that will unite in the future to produce a single unified 
framework for clinical decision support with a potential to completely

The new era of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced revolutionary 
data‑driven analysis paradigms that have led to significant advancements in 
information processing techniques in the context of clinical decision‑support 
systems. These advances have created unprecedented momentum in computational 
medical imaging applications and have given rise to new precision medicine 
research areas. Radiogenomics is a novel research field focusing on establishing 
associations between radiological features and genomic or molecular expression 
in order to shed light on the underlying disease mechanisms and enhance 
diagnostic procedures towards personalized medicine. The aim of the current 
review was to elucidate recent advances in radiogenomics research, focusing on 
deep learning with emphasis on radiology and oncology applications. The main 
deep learning radiogenomics architectures, together with the clinical questions 
addressed, and the achieved genetic or molecular correlations are presented, 
while a performance comparison of the proposed methodologies is conducted. 
Finally, current limitations, potentially understudied topics and future 
research directions are discussed.

BACKGROUND: On a tide of big data, machine learning is coming to its day. 
Referring to huge amounts of epigenetic data coming from biological experiments 
and clinic, machine learning can help in detecting epigenetic features in 
genome, finding correlations between phenotypes and modifications in histone or 
genes, accelerating the screen of lead compounds targeting epigenetics diseases 
and many other aspects around the study on epigenetics, which consequently 
realizes the hope of precision medicine.
METHODS: In this minireview, we will focus on reviewing the fundamentals and 
applications of machine learning methods which are regularly used in epigenetics 
filed and explain their features. Their advantages and disadvantages will also 
be discussed.
RESULTS: Machine learning algorithms have accelerated studies in precision 
medicine targeting epigenetics diseases.
CONCLUSION: In order to make full use of machine learning algorithms, one should 
get familiar with the pros and cons of them, which will benefit from big data by 
choosing the most suitable method(s).

Precision health leverages information from various sources, including omics, 
lifestyle, environment, social media, medical records, and medical insurance 
claims to enable personalized care, prevent and predict illness, and precise 
treatments. It extensively uses sensing technologies (e.g., electronic health 
monitoring devices), computations (e.g., machine learning), and communication 
(e.g., interaction between the health data centers). As health data contain 
sensitive private information, including the identity of patient and carer and 
medical conditions of the patient, proper care is required at all times. Leakage 
of these private information affects the personal life, including bullying, high 
insurance premium, and loss of job due to the medical history. Thus, the 
security, privacy of and trust on the information are of utmost importance. 
Moreover, government legislation and ethics committees demand the security and 
privacy of healthcare data. Besides, the public, who is the data source, always 
expects the security, privacy, and trust of their data. Otherwise, they can 
avoid contributing their data to the precision health system. Consequently, as 
the public is the targeted beneficiary of the system, the effectiveness of 
precision health diminishes. Herein, in the light of precision health data 
security, privacy, ethical and regulatory requirements, finding the best methods 
and techniques for the utilization of the health data, and thus precision health 
is essential. In this regard, firstly, this paper explores the regulations, 
ethical guidelines around the world, and domain-specific needs. Then it presents 
the requirements and investigates the associated challenges. Secondly, this 
paper investigates secure and privacy-preserving machine learning methods 
suitable for the computation of precision health data along with their usage in 
relevant health projects. Finally, it illustrates the best available techniques 
for precision health data security and privacy with a conceptual system model 
that enables compliance, ethics clearance, consent management, medical 
innovations, and developments in the health domain.

Artificial intelligence (AI) proves to have enormous potential in many areas of 
healthcare including research and chemical discoveries. Using large amounts of 
aggregated data, the AI can discover and learn further transforming these data 
into "usable" knowledge. Being well aware of this, the world's leading 
pharmaceutical companies have already begun to use artificial intelligence to 
improve their research regarding new drugs. The goal is to exploit modern 
computational biology and machine learning systems to predict the molecular 
behaviour and the likelihood of getting a useful drug, thus saving time and 
money on unnecessary tests. Clinical studies, electronic medical records, 
high-resolution medical images, and genomic profiles can be used as resources to 
aid drug development. Pharmaceutical and medical researchers have extensive data 
sets that can be analyzed by strong AI systems. This review focused on how 
computational biology and artificial intelligence technologies can be 
implemented by integrating the knowledge of cancer drugs, drug resistance, 
next-generation sequencing, genetic variants, and structural biology in the 
cancer precision drug discovery.

The data-driven identification of disease states and treatment options is a 
crucial challenge for precision oncology. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers 
unique opportunities for enhancing such predictive capabilities in the lab and 
the clinic. AI, including its best-known branch of research, machine learning, 
has significant potential to enable precision oncology well beyond relatively 
well-known pattern recognition applications, such as the supervised 
classification of single-source omics or imaging datasets. This perspective 
highlights key advances and challenges in that direction. Furthermore, it argues 
that AI's scope and depth of research need to be expanded to achieve 
ground-breaking progress in precision oncology.

Despite advances in neonatal care to prevent neonatal brain injury and 
neurodevelopmental impairment, predicting long-term outcome in neonates at risk 
for brain injury remains difficult. Early prognosis is currently based on 
cranial ultrasound (CUS), MRI, EEG, NIRS, and/or general movements assessed at 
specific ages, and predicting outcome in an individual (precision medicine) is 
not yet possible. New algorithms based on large databases and machine learning 
applied to clinical, neuromonitoring, and neuroimaging data and genetic analysis 
and assays measuring multiple biomarkers (omics) can fulfill the needs of modern 
neonatology. A synergy of all these techniques and the use of automatic 
quantitative analysis might give clinicians the possibility to provide 
patient-targeted decision-making for individualized diagnosis, therapy, and 
outcome prediction. This review will first focus on common neonatal neurological 
diseases, associated risk factors, and most common treatments. After that, we 
will discuss how precision medicine and machine learning (ML) approaches could 
change the future of prediction and prognosis in this field.

Precision oncology is grounded in the increasing understanding of genetic and 
molecular mechanisms that underly malignant disease and offer different 
treatment pathways for the individual patient. The growing complexity of medical 
data has led to the implementation of machine learning techniques that are 
vastly applied for risk assessment and outcome prediction using either 
supervised or unsupervised learning. Still largely overlooked is reinforcement 
learning (RL) that addresses sequential tasks by exploring the underlying 
dynamics of an environment and shaping it by taking actions in order to maximize 
cumulative rewards over time, thereby achieving optimal long-term outcomes. 
Recent breakthroughs in RL demonstrated remarkable results in gameplay and 
autonomous driving, often achieving human-like or even superhuman performance. 
While this type of machine learning holds the potential to become a helpful 
decision support tool, it comes with a set of distinctive challenges that need 
to be addressed to ensure applicability, validity and safety. In this review, we 
highlight recent advances of RL focusing on studies in oncology and point out 
current challenges and pitfalls that need to be accounted for in future studies 
in order to successfully develop RL-based decision support systems for precision 
oncology.

The aim of this position paper is to provide a brief overview of the current 
status of cardiovascular modelling and of the processes required and some of the 
challenges to be addressed to see wider exploitation in both personal health 
management and clinical practice. In most branches of engineering the concept of 
the digital twin, informed by extensive and continuous monitoring and coupled 
with robust data assimilation and simulation techniques, is gaining traction: 
the Gartner Group listed it as one of the top ten digital trends in 2018. The 
cardiovascular modelling community is starting to develop a much more systematic 
approach to the combination of physics, mathematics, control theory, artificial 
intelligence, machine learning, computer science and advanced engineering 
methodology, as well as working more closely with the clinical community to 
better understand and exploit physiological measurements, and indeed to develop 
jointly better measurement protocols informed by model-based understanding. 
Developments in physiological modelling, model personalisation, model outcome 
uncertainty, and the role of models in clinical decision support are addressed 
and 'where-next' steps and challenges discussed.

The management of retinal diseases relies heavily on digital imaging data, 
including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography (FA). 
Targeted feature extraction and the objective quantification of features provide 
important opportunities in biomarker discovery, disease burden assessment, and 
predicting treatment response. Additional important advantages include increased 
objectivity in interpretation, longitudinal tracking, and ability to incorporate 
computational models to create automated diagnostic and clinical decision 
support systems. Advances in computational technology, including deep learning 
and radiomics, open new doors for developing an imaging phenotype that may 
provide in-depth personalized disease characterization and enhance opportunities 
in precision medicine. In this review, we summarize current quantitative and 
radiomic imaging biomarkers described in the literature for age-related macular 
degeneration and diabetic eye disease using imaging modalities such as OCT, FA, 
and OCT angiography (OCTA). Various approaches used to identify and extract 
these biomarkers that utilize artificial intelligence and deep learning are also 
summarized in this review. These quantifiable biomarkers and automated 
approaches have unleashed new frontiers of personalized medicine where 
treatments are tailored, based on patient-specific longitudinally trackable 
biomarkers, and response monitoring can be achieved with a high degree of 
accuracy.

Precision medicine has recently become widely advocated. It revolves around the 
individual patient, taking into account genetic, biomarker, phenotypic or 
psychosocial characteristics and uses biological, mechanical and/or personal 
variables to optimise individual therapy. In silico testing, such as the Virtual 
Physiological Human project, is being promoted to predict risk and to test 
treatments and medical devices. It combines artificial intelligence and 
computational modelling to select the best therapeutic option for the individual 
patient.

Personalised medicine aims to find an individualized approach for each 
particular patient. Most factors used in current psychiatry, however, depend on 
the assessment made by the individual clinician and lack a higher degree of 
reliability. Precision medicine bases decisions on quantifiable indicators 
available thanks to the tremendous progress in science and technology 
facilitating the acquisition, processing and analysis of huge amounts of data. 
So far, psychiatry has not been benefiting enough from the advanced diagnostic 
technologies; nevertheless, we are witnessing the dawn of the era of precision 
psychiatry, starting with the gathering of sufficient amounts of data and its 
analysis by the means of artificial intelligence and machine learning. First 
results of this approach in psychiatry are available, which facilitate diagnosis 
assessment, course prediction, and appropriate treatment choice. These processes 
are often so complex and difficult to understand that they may resemble a "black 
box", which can slow down the acceptance of the results of this approach in 
clinical practice. Still, bringing precision medicine including psychiatry to 
standard clinical practice is a big challenge that can result in a completely 
new and transformative concept of health care. Such extensive changes naturally 
have both their supporters and opponents. This paper aims to familiarize 
clinically oriented physicians with precision psychiatry and to attract their 
attention to its recent developments. We cover the theoretical basis of 
precision medicine, its specifics in psychiatry, and provide examples of its use 
in the field of diagnostic assessment, course prediction, and appropriate 
treatment planning.

Technological advances in omics evaluation, bioinformatics, and artificial 
intelligence have made us rethink ways to improve patient outcomes. Collective 
quantification and characterization of biological data including genomics, 
epigenomics, metabolomics, and proteomics is now feasible at low cost with rapid 
turnover. Significant advances in the integration methods of these multiomics 
data sets by machine learning promise us a holistic view of disease pathogenesis 
and yield biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Using machine learning 
tools and algorithms, it is possible to integrate multiomics data with clinical 
information to develop predictive models that identify risk before the condition 
is clinically apparent, thus facilitating early interventions to improve the 
health trajectories of the patients. In this review, we intend to update the 
readers on the recent developments related to the use of artificial intelligence 
in integrating multiomic and clinical data sets in the field of perinatology, 
focusing on neonatal intensive care and the opportunities for precision 
medicine. We intend to briefly discuss the potential negative societal and 
ethical consequences of using artificial intelligence in healthcare. We are 
poised for a new era in medicine where computational analysis of biological and 
clinical data sets will make precision medicine a reality. IMPACT: 
Biotechnological advances have made multiomic evaluations feasible and 
integration of multiomics data may provide a holistic view of disease 
pathophysiology. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning tools are being 
increasingly used in healthcare for diagnosis, prognostication, and outcome 
predictions. Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning tools for 
integration of multiomics and clinical data will pave the way for precision 
medicine in perinatology.

Since Human Genome Project (HGP) revealed the heterogeneity of individuals, 
precision medicine that proposes the customized healthcare has become an 
intractable and hot research. Meanwhile, as the Precision Medicine Initiative 
launched, precision drug design which aims at maximizing therapeutic effects 
while minimizing undesired side effects for an individual patient has entered a 
new stage. One of the key strategies of precision drug design is target based 
drug design. Once a key pathogenic target is identified, rational drug design 
which constitutes the major part of precision drug design can be performed. 
Examples of rational drug design on novel druggable targets and protein-protein 
interaction surfaces are summarized in this review. Besides, various kinds of 
computational modeling and simulation approaches increasingly benefit for the 
drug discovery progress. Molecular dynamic simulation, drug target prediction 
and in silico clinical trials are discussed. Moreover, due to the powerful 
ability in handling high-dimensional data and complex system, deep learning has 
efficiently promoted the applications of artificial intelligence in drug 
discovery and design. In this review, deep learning methods that tailor to 
precision drug design are carefully discussed. When a drug molecule is 
discovered, the development of specific targeted drug delivery system becomes 
another key aspect of precision drug design. Therefore, state-of-the-art 
techniques of drug delivery system including antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), 
and ligand-targeted conjugates are also included in this review.

In anticipation of a major transformation in healthcare, this review provides 
highlights that anticipate the near future for oral public health (and beyond). 
Personalized or precision healthcare reflects the expectation that advances in 
genomics, imaging, and other domains will extend our risk assessment, 
diagnostic, and prognostic capabilities, and enables more effective prevention 
and therapeutic options for all Americans. Meanwhile, the current healthcare 
system does not meet cost, access, or quality criteria for all Americans. It is 
now an imperative that the success of "smart," quality, and cost-effective high 
definition precision healthcare requires a public health perspective for several 
reasons: a) to enhance generalizability, b) to assess methods of implementation, 
and c) to focus on both risk and prevention in large and small populations, 
thereby providing a balance between the generation of long-term knowledge and 
short-term health gains. Sensitivity and resolution, reasonable cost, access to 
all Americans, coordinated comprehensive care, and advances in whole genome 
sequencing (WGS) and big data analyses, coupled to other advances in 
biotechnology and digital/artificial intelligence/machine learning devices, and 
the behavioral, social, and environmental sciences, offer remarkable 
opportunities to improve the health and wellness of the American people 
[genotype + phenotype + environment + behavior = high definition healthcare]. 
The opportunity is to significantly improve the well-being and life expectancy 
of all people across the lifespan including the least-advantaged people in our 
society and potentially increase access, reduce the national costs, and improve 
health outcomes.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) are multifactorial and characterized 
by dysfunctional, time dependent, highly varying hyper- to hypo-inflammatory 
host responses contributing to disease severity. Furthermore, host-pathogen 
interactions are diverse and difficult to identify and characterize, due to the 
many different disease endotypes. There is a need for both refined bedside 
diagnostics as well as novel targeted treatment options to improve outcome in 
NSTI. In order to achieve clinically relevant results and to guide preclinical 
and clinical research the vast amount of fragmented clinical and experimental 
datasets, which often include omics data at different levels (transcriptomics, 
proteomics, metabolomics, etc.), need to be organized, harmonized, integrated, 
and analyzed taking into account the Big Data nature of these datasets. In this 
chapter, we address these matters from a systems perspective and yet 
personalized approach. The chapter provides an overview on the increasingly more 
frequent use of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to aggregate and 
generate knowledge from burgeoning clinical and biochemical information, 
addresses the challenges to manage this information, and summarizes current 
efforts to develop robust computer-aided clinical decision support systems so to 
tackle the serious challenges in NSTI diagnosis, stratification, and optimized 
tailored therapy.

Omics technologies are widely used in biomedical research. Precision medicine 
focuses on individual-level disease treatment and prevention. Here, we propose 
the usage of the term 'precision omics' to represent the combinatorial strategy 
that applies omics to translate large-scale molecular omics data for precision 
disease understanding and accurate disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention. 
Given the complexity of both omics and precision medicine, precision omics 
requires standardized representation and integration of heterogeneous data 
types. Ontology has emerged as an important artificial intelligence component to 
become critical for standard data and metadata representation, standardization 
and integration. To support precision omics, we propose a precision omics 
ontology hypothesis, which hypothesizes that the effectiveness of precision 
omics is positively correlated with the interoperability of ontologies used for 
data and knowledge integration. Therefore, to make effective precision omics 
studies, interoperable ontologies are required to standardize and incorporate 
heterogeneous data and knowledge in a human- and computer-interpretable manner. 
Methods for efficient development and application of interoperable ontologies 
are proposed and illustrated. With the interoperable omics data and knowledge, 
omics tools such as OmicsViz can also be evolved to process, integrate, 
visualize and analyze various omics data, leading to the identification of new 
knowledge and hypotheses of molecular mechanisms underlying the outcomes of 
diseases such as COVID-19. Given extensive COVID-19 omics research, we propose 
the strategy of precision omics supported by interoperable ontologies, 
accompanied with ontology-based semantic reasoning and machine learning, leading 
to systematic disease mechanism understanding and rational design of precision 
treatment and prevention.
SHORT ABSTRACT: Precision medicine focuses on individual-level disease treatment 
and prevention. Precision omics is a new strategy that applies omics for 
precision medicine research, which requires standardized representation and 
integration of individual genetics and phenotypes, experimental conditions, and 
data analysis settings. Ontology has emerged as an important artificial 
intelligence component to become critical for standard data and metadata 
representation, standardization and integration. To support precision omics, 
interoperable ontologies are required in order to standardize and incorporate 
heterogeneous data and knowledge in a human- and computer-interpretable manner. 
With the interoperable omics data and knowledge, omics tools such as OmicsViz 
can also be evolved to process, integrate, visualize and analyze various omics 
data, leading to the identification of new knowledge and hypotheses of molecular 
mechanisms underlying disease outcomes. The precision COVID-19 omics study is 
provided as the primary use case to illustrate the rationale and implementation 
of the precision omics strategy.

The integration of artificial intelligence in precision medicine has 
revolutionized healthcare delivery. Precision medicine identifies the phenotype 
of particular patients with less-common responses to treatment. Recent studies 
have demonstrated that translational research exploring the convergence between 
artificial intelligence and precision medicine will help solve the most 
difficult challenges facing precision medicine. Here, we discuss different 
aspects of artificial intelligence in precision medicine that improve healthcare 
delivery. First, we discuss how artificial intelligence changes the landscape of 
precision medicine and the evolution of artificial intelligence in precision 
medicine. Second, we highlight the synergies between artificial intelligence and 
precision medicine and promises of artificial intelligence and precision 
medicine in healthcare delivery. Third, we briefly explain the promise of big 
data analytics and the integration of nanomaterials in precision medicine. Last, 
we highlight the challenges and opportunities of artificial intelligence in 
precision medicine.

Precision oncology is an innovative approach to cancer care in which diagnosis, 
prognosis, and treatment are informed by the individual patient's genetic and 
molecular profile. The rapid development of novel high-throughput omics 
technologies in recent years has led to the generation of massive amount of 
complex patient data, which in turn has prompted the development of novel 
computational infrastructures, platforms, and tools to store, retrieve, and 
analyze this data efficiently. Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular 
its subfield of machine learning, is ideal for deciphering patterns in large 
datasets and offers unique opportunities for advancing precision oncology. In 
this chapter, we provide an overview of the various public data resources and 
applications of AI in precision oncology and cancer research, from subtype 
identification to drug prioritization, using multi-omics datasets. We also 
discuss the impact of AI-powered medical image analysis in oncology and present 
the first diagnostic FDA-approved AI-powered tools.

Mental disorders account for around one-third of disability worldwide and cause 
enormous personal and societal burden. Current pharmacotherapies and 
nonpharmacotherapies do help many patients, but there are still high rates of 
partial or no response, delayed effect, and unfavorable adverse effects. The 
current diagnostic taxonomy of mental disorders by the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Classification of 
Diseases relies on presenting signs and symptoms, but does not reflect evidence 
from neurobiological and behavioral systems. However, in the last decades, the 
understanding of biological mechanisms underlying mental disorders has grown and 
can be used for the development of precision medicine, that is, to deliver a 
patient-tailored individual treatment. Precision medicine may incorporate 
genetic variants contributing to the mental disorder and the response to 
pharmacotherapies, but also consider gene ¥ environment interactions, 
blood-based markers, neuropsychological tests, data from electronic health 
records, early life adversity, stressful life events, and very proximal factors 
such as lifestyle, nutrition, and sport. Methods such as artificial intelligence 
and the underlying machine learning and deep learning approaches provide the 
framework to stratify patients, initiate specific tailored treatments and thus 
increase response rates, reduce adverse effects and medical errors. In 
conclusion, precision medicine uses measurable health parameters to identify 
individuals at risk of a mental disorder, to improve the diagnostic process and 
to deliver a patient-tailored treatment.

Recent technological innovations in the field of mass spectrometry have 
supported the use of metabolomics analysis for precision medicine. This growth 
has been allowed also by the application of algorithms to data analysis, 
including multivariate and machine learning methods, which are fundamental to 
managing large number of variables and samples. In the present review, we 
reported and discussed the application of artificial intelligence (AI) 
strategies for metabolomics data analysis. Particularly, we focused on widely 
used non-linear machine learning classifiers, such as ANN, random forest, and 
support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. A discussion of recent studies and 
research focused on disease classification, biomarker identification and early 
diagnosis is presented. Challenges in the implementation of metabolomics-AI 
systems, limitations thereof and recent tools were also discussed.

Recently, the concept of radiomics has emerged from radiation oncology. It is a 
novel approach for solving the issues of precision medicine and how it can be 
performed, based on multimodality medical images that are non-invasive, fast and 
low in cost. Radiomics is the comprehensive analysis of massive numbers of 
medical images in order to extract a large number of phenotypic features 
(radiomic biomarkers) reflecting cancer traits, and it explores the associations 
between the features and patients' prognoses in order to improve decision-making 
in precision medicine. Individual patients can be stratified into subtypes based 
on radiomic biomarkers that contain information about cancer traits that 
determine the patient's prognosis. Machine-learning algorithms of AI are 
boosting the powers of radiomics for prediction of prognoses or factors 
associated with treatment strategies, such as survival time, recurrence, adverse 
events, and subtypes. Therefore, radiomic approaches, in combination with AI, 
may potentially enable practical use of precision medicine in radiation therapy 
by predicting outcomes and toxicity for individual patients.

Big data are a major driver in the development of precision medicine. Efficient 
analysis methods are needed to transform big data into clinically-actionable 
knowledge. To accomplish this, many researchers are turning toward machine 
learning (ML), an approach of artificial intelligence (AI) that utilizes modern 
algorithms to give computers the ability to learn. Much of the effort to advance 
ML for precision medicine has been focused on the development and implementation 
of algorithms and the generation of ever larger quantities of genomic sequence 
data and electronic health records. However, relevance and accuracy of the data 
are as important as quantity of data in the advancement of ML for precision 
medicine. For common diseases, physiological genomic readouts in 
disease-applicable tissues may be an effective surrogate to measure the effect 
of genetic and environmental factors and their interactions that underlie 
disease development and progression. Disease-applicable tissue may be difficult 
to obtain, but there are important exceptions such as kidney needle biopsy 
specimens. As AI continues to advance, new analytical approaches, including 
those that go beyond data correlation, need to be developed and ethical issues 
of AI need to be addressed. Physiological genomic readouts in disease-relevant 
tissues, combined with advanced AI, can be a powerful approach for precision 
medicine for common diseases.

Precision medicine is increasingly recognized as a promising approach to improve 
disease treatment, taking into consideration the individual clinical and 
biological characteristics shared by specific subgroups of patients. In specific 
fields such as oncology and hematology, precision medicine has already started 
to be implemented in the clinical setting and molecular testing is routinely 
used to select treatments with higher efficacy and reduced adverse effects. The 
application of precision medicine in psychiatry is still in its early phases. 
However, there are already examples of predictive models based on clinical data 
or combinations of clinical, neuroimaging and biological data. While the power 
of single clinical predictors would remain inadequate if analyzed only with 
traditional statistical approaches, these predictors are now increasingly used 
to impute machine learning models that can have adequate accuracy even in the 
presence of relatively small sample size. These models have started to be 
applied to disentangle relevant clinical questions that could lead to a more 
effective management of psychiatric disorders, such as prediction of response to 
the mood stabilizer lithium, resistance to antidepressants in major depressive 
disorder or stratification of the risk and outcome prediction in schizophrenia. 
In this narrative review, we summarized the most important findings in precision 
medicine in psychiatry based on studies that constructed machine learning models 
using clinical, neuroimaging and/or biological data. Limitations and barriers to 
the implementation of precision psychiatry in the clinical setting, as well as 
possible solutions and future perspectives, will be presented.

Recent years have witnessed a shift to more objective and biologically-driven 
methods for central nervous system (CNS) tumor classification. The 2016 world 
health organization (WHO) classification update ("blue book") introduced 
molecular diagnostic criteria into the definitions of specific entities as a 
response to the plethora of evidence that key molecular alterations define 
distinct tumor types and are clinically meaningful. While in the past such 
diagnostic alterations included specific mutations, copy number changes, or gene 
fusions, the emergence of DNA methylation arrays in recent years has similarly 
resulted in improved diagnostic precision, increased reliability, and has 
provided an effective framework for the discovery of new tumor types. In many 
instances, there is an intimate relationship between these mutations/fusions and 
DNA methylation signatures. The adoption of methylation data into neuro-oncology 
nosology has been greatly aided by the availability of technology compatible 
with clinical diagnostics, along with the development of a freely accessible 
machine learning-based classifier. In this review, we highlight the utility of 
DNA methylation profiling in CNS tumor classification with a focus on recently 
described novel and rare tumor types, as well as its contribution to refining 
existing types.

INTRODUCTION: Multiple algorithms based on 12-lead ECG measurements have been 
proposed to identify the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and left 
ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) locations from which ventricular tachycardia 
(VT) and frequent premature ventricular complex (PVC) originate. However, a 
clinical-grade machine learning algorithm that automatically analyzes 
characteristics of 12-lead ECGs and predicts RVOT or LVOT origins of VT and PVC 
is not currently available. The effective ablation sites of RVOT and LVOT, 
confirmed by a successful ablation procedure, provide evidence to create RVOT 
and LVOT labels for the machine learning model.
METHODS: We randomly sampled training, validation, and testing data sets from 
420 patients who underwent successful catheter ablation (CA) to treat VT or PVC, 
containing 340 (81%), 38 (9%), and 42 (10%) patients, respectively. We 
iteratively trained a machine learning algorithm supplied with 1,600,800 
features extracted via our proprietary algorithm from 12-lead ECGs of the 
patients in the training cohort. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver 
operating characteristic curve was calculated from the internal validation data 
set to choose an optimal discretization cutoff threshold.
RESULTS: The proposed approach attained the following performance: accuracy 
(ACC) of 97.62 (87.44-99.99), weighted F1-score of 98.46 (90-100), AUC of 98.99 
(96.89-100), sensitivity (SE) of 96.97 (82.54-99.89), and specificity (SP) of 
100 (62.97-100).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed multistage diagnostic scheme attained clinical-grade 
precision of prediction for LVOT and RVOT locations of VT origin with fewer 
applicability restrictions than prior studies.

offered by next-generation sequencing technologies and rapid growth in 
biomedical publication has led to the advent of the big-data era. Integration of 
artificial intelligence (AI) approaches such as machine learning, deep learning, 
and natural language processing (NLP) to tackle the challenges of scalability 
and high dimensionality of data and to transform big data into clinically 
actionable knowledge is expanding and becoming the foundation of precision 
medicine. In this paper, we review the current status and future directions of 
AI application in cancer genomics within the context of workflows to integrate 
genomic analysis for precision cancer care. The existing solutions of AI and 
their limitations in cancer genetic testing and diagnostics such as variant 
calling and interpretation are critically analyzed. Publicly available tools or 
algorithms for key NLP technologies in the literature mining for evidence-based 
clinical recommendations are reviewed and compared. In addition, the present 
paper highlights the challenges to AI adoption in digital healthcare with regard 
to data requirements, algorithmic transparency, reproducibility, and real-world 
assessment, and discusses the importance of preparing patients and physicians 
for modern digitized healthcare. We believe that AI will remain the main driver 
to healthcare transformation toward precision medicine, yet the unprecedented 
challenges posed should be addressed to ensure safety and beneficial impact to 
healthcare.

A targeted cancer therapy is only useful if there is a way to accurately 
identify the tumors that are susceptible to that therapy. Thus rapid expansion 
in the number of available targeted cancer treatments has been accompanied by a 
robust effort to subdivide the traditional histological and anatomical tumor 
classifications into molecularly defined subtypes. This review highlights the 
history of the paired evolution of targeted therapies and biomarkers, reviews 
currently used methods for subtype identification, and discusses challenges to 
the implementation of precision oncology as well as possible solutions.

Machine learning (ML) is being ubiquitously incorporated into everyday products 
such as Internet search, email spam filters, product recommendations, image 
classification, and speech recognition. New approaches for highly integrated 
manufacturing and automation such as the Industry 4.0 and the Internet of things 
are also converging with ML methodologies. Many approaches incorporate complex 
artificial neural network architectures and are collectively referred to as deep 
learning (DL) applications. These methods have been shown capable of 
representing and learning predictable relationships in many diverse forms of 
data and hold promise for transforming the future of omics research and 
applications in precision medicine. Omics and electronic health record data pose 
considerable challenges for DL. This is due to many factors such as low signal 
to noise, analytical variance, and complex data integration requirements. 
However, DL models have already been shown capable of both improving the ease of 
data encoding and predictive model performance over alternative approaches. It 
may not be surprising that concepts encountered in DL share similarities with 
those observed in biological message relay systems such as gene, protein, and 
metabolite networks. This expert review examines the challenges and 
opportunities for DL at a systems and biological scale for a precision medicine 
readership.

Precision medicine (MP), using machine learning (ML) techniques of artificial 
intelligence (AI), analyzes the so-called "big data" to improve diagnostic 
skills and predictive response to therapy, in order to tailor the treatment on 
individual characteristics. Furthermore, the use of large databases is limited 
by their very nature, as data and not values, capable of threatening the 
validity and generalizability of the conclusions. Currently, for this reason, 
interventions on populations, subpopulations or groups are still fundamental, 
favoring, especially in the pharmacological field, the response of the "average 
patient", over the particular case. Therefore, it is essential to carry out 
methodologically robust, prospective studies of comparison between teams of 
doctors who use systems based on algorithms and teams that do not are using 
them, avoiding direct comparisons, less significant, between doctors and AI. 
Only in this case will technologies effectively applicable in real rather than 
experimental clinical contexts be implemented in the near future.

AIMS: To provide an overview of the role of cardiovascular (CV) imaging in 
facilitating and advancing the field of precision medicine in CV disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Non-invasive CV imaging is essential to accurately and 
efficiently phenotype patients with heart disease, including coronary artery 
disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF). Various modalities, such as 
echocardiography, nuclear cardiology, cardiac computed tomography (CT), 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), and invasive coronary angiography, and 
in some cases a combination, can be required to provide sufficient information 
for diagnosis and management. Taking CAD as an example, imaging is essential for 
the detection and functional assessment of coronary stenoses, as well as for the 
quantification of cardiac function and ischaemic myocardial damage. Furthermore, 
imaging may detect and quantify coronary atherosclerosis, potentially identify 
plaques at increased risk of rupture, and guide coronary interventions. In 
patients with HF, imaging helps identify specific aetiologies, quantify damage, 
and assess its impact on cardiac function. Imaging plays a central role in 
individualizing diagnosis and management and to determine the optimal treatment 
for each patient to increase the likelihood of response and improve patient 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Advances in all imaging techniques continue to improve accuracy, 
sensitivity, and standardization of functional and prognostic assessments, and 
identify established and novel therapeutic targets. Combining imaging with 
artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer algorithms, as well as 
with genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic approaches, will become 
state of the art in the future to understand pathologies of CAD and HF, and in 
the development of new, targeted therapies.

The ambition of precision medicine is to design and optimize the pathway for 
diagnosis, therapeutic intervention, and prognosis by using large 
multidimensional biological datasets that capture individual variability in 
genes, function and environment. This offers clinicians the opportunity to more 
carefully tailor early interventions- whether treatment or preventative in 
nature-to each individual patient. Taking advantage of high performance computer 
capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can now achieve reasonable 
success in predicting risk in certain cancers and cardiovascular disease from 
available multidimensional clinical and biological data. In contrast, less 
progress has been made with the neurodevelopmental disorders, which include 
intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy and 
broader neurodevelopmental disorders. Much hope is pinned on the opportunity to 
quantify risk from patterns of genomic variation, including the functional 
characterization of genes and variants, but this ambition is confounded by 
phenotypic and etiologic heterogeneity, along with the rare and variable 
penetrant nature of the underlying risk variants identified so far. Structural 
and functional brain imaging and neuropsychological and neurophysiological 
markers may provide further dimensionality, but often require more development 
to achieve sensitivity for diagnosis. Herein, therefore, lies a precision 
medicine conundrum: can artificial intelligence offer a breakthrough in 
predicting risks and prognosis for neurodevelopmental disorders? In this review 
we will examine these complexities, and consider some of the strategies whereby 
artificial intelligence may overcome them.

Precision medicine is one of the recent and powerful developments in medical 
care, which has the potential to improve the traditional symptom-driven practice 
of medicine, allowing earlier interventions using advanced diagnostics and 
tailoring better and economically personalized treatments. Identifying the best 
pathway to personalized and population medicine involves the ability to analyze 
comprehensive patient information together with broader aspects to monitor and 
distinguish between sick and relatively healthy people, which will lead to a 
better understanding of biological indicators that can signal shifts in health. 
While the complexities of disease at the individual level have made it difficult 
to utilize healthcare information in clinical decision-making, some of the 
existing constraints have been greatly minimized by technological advancements. 
To implement effective precision medicine with enhanced ability to positively 
impact patient outcomes and provide real-time decision support, it is important 
to harness the power of electronic health records by integrating disparate data 
sources and discovering patient-specific patterns of disease progression. Useful 
analytic tools, technologies, databases, and approaches are required to augment 
networking and interoperability of clinical, laboratory and public health 
systems, as well as addressing ethical and social issues related to the privacy 
and protection of healthcare data with effective balance. Developing 
multifunctional machine learning platforms for clinical data extraction, 
aggregation, management and analysis can support clinicians by efficiently 
stratifying subjects to understand specific scenarios and optimize 
decision-making. Implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare is a 
compelling vision that has the potential in leading to the significant 
improvements for achieving the goals of providing real-time, better personalized 
and population medicine at lower costs. In this study, we focused on analyzing 
and discussing various published artificial intelligence and machine learning 
solutions, approaches and perspectives, aiming to advance academic solutions in 
paving the way for a new data-centric era of discovery in healthcare.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We critically evaluate the future potential of machine 
learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and artificial intelligence (AI) in precision 
medicine. The goal of this work is to show progress in ML in digital health, to 
exemplify future needs and trends, and to identify any essential prerequisites 
of AI and ML for precision health.
RECENT FINDINGS: High-throughput technologies are delivering growing volumes of 
biomedical data, such as large-scale genome-wide sequencing assays; libraries of 
medical images; or drug perturbation screens of healthy, developing, and 
diseased tissue. Multi-omics data in biomedicine is deep and complex, offering 
an opportunity for data-driven insights and automated disease classification. 
Learning from these data will open our understanding and definition of healthy 
baselines and disease signatures. State-of-the-art applications of deep neural 
networks include digital image recognition, single-cell clustering, and virtual 
drug screens, demonstrating breadths and power of ML in biomedicine.
SUMMARY: Significantly, AI and systems biology have embraced big data challenges 
and may enable novel biotechnology-derived therapies to facilitate the 
implementation of precision medicine approaches.

The field of precision medicine explores disease treatments by looking at 
genetic, socio-environmental, and clinical factors, thus trying to provide a 
holistic view of a person's health. Public health, on the other hand, is focused 
on improving the health of populations through preventive strategies and timely 
interventions. With recent advances in technology, we are able to collect, 
analyze and store for the first-time large volumes of real-time, diverse and 
continuous health data. Typically, the field of precision medicine deals with a 
huge amount of data from few individuals; public health, on the other hand, 
deals with limited data from a population. With the coming of Big Data, the 
fields of precision medicine and public health are converging into precision 
public health, the study of biological and genetic factors supported by large 
amounts of population data. In this paper, we explore through a comprehensive 
review the data types and use cases found in precision medicine and public 
health. We also discuss how these data types and use cases can converge toward 
precision public health, as well as challenges and opportunities provided by 
research and analyses of health data.

AIM: To identify and critically appraise studies of prediction models, developed 
using machine learning (ML) methods, for determining the optimal dosing of 
unfractionated heparin (UFH).
METHODS: Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, International Pharmaceutical 
Abstracts and IEEE Xplore databases were searched from inception to 31 January 
2020 to identify relevant studies using key search terms synonymous with 
artificial intelligence or ML, 'prediction', 'dose', 'activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT)' and 'UFH.' Studies had to have used ML methods for 
developing models that predicted optimal dose of UFH or target therapeutic aPTT 
levels in the hospital setting. The CHARMS Checklist was used to assess quality 
and risk of bias of included studies.
RESULTS: Of 8393 retrieved abstracts, 61 underwent full text review and eight 
studies met inclusion criteria. Four studies described models for predicting 
aPTT, three studies described models predicting optimal dose of heparin during 
dialysis and one study described a model that used surrogate outcomes of 
clotting and bleeding to predict a therapeutic aPTT. Studies varied widely in 
reporting of study participants, feature characterisation and selection, 
handling of missing data, sample size calculations and the intended clinical 
application of the model. Only one study conducted an external validation and no 
studies evaluated model impacts in clinical practice.
CONCLUSION: Studies of ML models for UFH dosing are few and none report a model 
ready for routine clinical use. Existing studies are limited by low 
methodological quality, inadequate reporting of study factors and absence of 
external validation and impact analysis.

The past decade has witnessed a significant paradigm shift in the clinical 
approach to autoimmune diseases, lead primarily by initiatives in precision 
medicine, precision health and precision public health initiatives. An 
understanding and pragmatic implementation of these approaches require an 
understanding of the drivers, gaps and limitations of precision medicine. 
Gaining the trust of the public and patients is paramount but understanding that 
technologies such as artificial intelligences and machine learning still require 
context that can only be provided by human input or what is called augmented 
machine learning. The role of genomics, the microbiome and proteomics, such as 
autoantibody testing, requires continuing refinement through research and 
pragmatic approaches to their use in applied precision medicine.

Basic scientists and drug developers are accelerating innovations toward the 
goal of precision medicine. Regulators create pathways for timely patient access 
to precision medicines, including individualized therapies. Healthcare payors 
acknowledge the need for change but downstream innovation for coverage and 
reimbursement is only haltingly occurring. Performance uncertainty, high 
price-tags, payment timing, and actuarial risk issues associated with precision 
medicines present novel financial challenges for payors. With traditional drug 
reimbursement frameworks, payment is based on an assumed randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) projection of real-world effectiveness, a "trial-and-project" 
strategy; the clinical benefit realized for patients is not usually ascertained 
ex post by collection of real-world data (RWD). To mitigate financial risks 
resulting from clinical performance uncertainty, manufacturers and payors 
devised "track-and-pay" frameworks (i.e., the tracking of a pre-agreed treatment 
outcome which is linked to financial consequences). Whereas some track-and-pay 
arrangements have been successful, inherent weaknesses include the potential for 
misalignment of incentives, the risk of channeling of patients, and a failure to 
use the RWD generated to enable continuous learning about treatments. "Precision 
reimbursement" (PR) intends to overcome inherent weaknesses of simple 
track-and-pay schemes. In combining the collection of RWD with advanced 
analytics (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning) to generate 
actionable real-world evidence, with prospective alignment of incentives across 
all stakeholders (including providers and patients), and with pre-agreed use and 
dissemination of information generated, PR becomes a "learn-and-predict" model 
of payment for performance. We here describe in detail the concept of PR and lay 
out the next steps to make it a reality.

INTRODUCTION: Being the most common primary brain tumor, glioblastoma presents 
as an extremely challenging malignancy to treat with dismal outcomes despite 
treatment. Varying molecular epidemiology of glioblastoma between patients and 
intra-tumoral heterogeneity explains the failure of current one-size-fits-all 
treatment modalities. Radiomics uses machine learning to identify salient 
features of the tumor on brain imaging and promises patient-specific management 
in glioblastoma patients.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive review of the available literature on 
studies investigating the role of radiomics and radiogenomics models for the 
diagnosis, stratification, prognostication as well as treatment planning and 
monitoring of glioblastoma.
RESULTS: Classifiers based on a combination of various MRI sequences, genetic 
information and clinical data can predict non-invasive tumor diagnosis, overall 
survival and treatment response with reasonable accuracy. However, the use of 
radiomics for glioblastoma treatment remains in infancy as larger sample sizes, 
standardized image acquisition and data extraction techniques are needed to 
develop machine learning models that can be translated effectively into clinical 
practice.
CONCLUSION: Radiomics has the potential to transform the scope of glioblastoma 
management through personalized medicine.

BACKGROUND: Systems biology and network modeling represent, nowadays, the 
hallmark approaches for the development of predictive and targeted-treatment 
based precision medicine. The study of health and disease as properties of the 
human body system allows the understanding of the genotype-phenotype 
relationship through the definition of molecular interactions and dependencies. 
In this scenario, metabolism plays a central role as its interactions are well 
characterized and it is considered an important indicator of the genotype- 
phenotype associations. In metabolic systems biology, the genome-scale metabolic 
models are the primary scaffolds to integrate multi-omics data as well as cell-, 
tissue-, condition- specific information. Modeling the metabolism has both 
investigative and predictive values. Several methods have been proposed to model 
systems, which involve steady-state or kinetic approaches, and to extract 
knowledge through machine and deep learning.
METHODS: This review collects, analyzes, and compares the suitable data and 
computational approaches for the exploration of metabolic networks as tools for 
the development of precision medicine. To this extent, we organized it into 
three main sections: "Data and Databases", "Methods and Tools", and "Metabolic 
Networks for medicine". In the first one, we have collected the most used data 
and relative databases to build and annotate metabolic models. In the second 
section, we have reported the state-of-the-art methods and relative tools to 
reconstruct, simulate, and interpret metabolic systems. Finally, we have 
reported the most recent and innovative studies that exploited metabolic 
networks to study several pathological conditions, not only those directly 
related to metabolism.
CONCLUSION: We think that this review can be a guide to researchers of different 
disciplines, from computer science to biology and medicine, in exploring the 
power, challenges and future promises of the metabolism as predictor and target 
of the so-called P4 medicine (predictive, preventive, personalized and 
participatory).

Development of post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) following open-heart 
surgery is a significant clinical and economic burden. Despite advancements in 
medical therapies, the incidence of POAF remains elevated at 25-40%. Early work 
focused on detecting arrhythmias from electrocardiograms as well as identifying 
pre-operative risk factors from medical records. However, further progress has 
been stagnant, and a deeper understanding of pathogenesis and significant 
influences is warranted. With the advent of more complex machine learning (ML) 
algorithms and high-throughput sequencing, we have an unprecedented ability to 
capture and predict POAF in real-time. Integration of multimodal heterogeneous 
data and application of ML can generate a paradigm shift for diagnosis and 
treatment. This will require a concerted effort to consolidate and streamline 
real-time data. Herein, we will review the current literature and emerging 
opportunities aimed at predictive targets and new insights into the mechanisms 
underlying long-term sequelae of POAF.

Besides concerns about the increasing prevalence of psychiatric disorders and 
the significant burdens and costs, there are concerns about its validity. The 
dilemma of validity went so far that studies described the diagnoses in 
psychiatry as scientifically worthless. We suggest integrating psychiatry and 
medical biotechnology and using biotechnological products in psychiatric aspects 
help psychiatry become more precise, strengthen its position among other 
sciences, and increase its scientific credibility by giving examples. For this 
matter, we need different inputs to choose between the vast outputs. The most 
common inputs are clinical symptoms, cognitive function, individual and 
environmental risk factors, molecular markers, genetic markers, neuroimaging 
signs, and big data. Some molecular markers have been shown to have a 
relationship with psychiatric disorders such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor 
Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α). Genetic studies might evolve the most accurate part 
of precision psychiatry. Currently, and through the developments in technology, 
genome-wide association studies have become available. In neuroimaging signs, 
psychiatric disorders are associated with generalized rather than focal brain 
network dysfunction, and functional magnetic resonance imaging could be 
performed to study them. It would exhibit different aberrancies in various 
psychiatric disorders. In big data, the constitution of predictive models and 
movement toward precision psychiatry can be led by using artificial intelligence 
and machine learning.

Recent technological advances continue to expand the universe of big data in 
biomedicine along the four axes of variety, veracity, volume, and velocity, 
fueling innovations in research and discovery while transforming care delivery. 
These advances allow quantitative capture of multimodal health, behavioral, 
social, and environmental data from n-of-all in near real-time to support the 
development of new therapies and personalization of treatment decisions for the 
n-of-one. Application of advanced analytical methods, including artificial 
intelligence and machine learning, to these modern data assets can greatly 
propel our understanding of health and disease, accelerating the development of 
safer and more effective anticancer therapies. In this perspective, we 
rationalize the creation of a universally accessible digital highway system as a 
foundational infrastructure to enable data fluidity in an equitable manner. An 
interoperable and integrated digital inter-state highway can facilitate 
efficient derivation of insights from biomedical big data to improve health 
outcomes and ensure that the U.S. remains at the leading-edge innovations in 
technology, advanced analytics, and precision medicine.

Radiomics, artificial intelligence, and deep learning figure amongst recent 
buzzwords in current medical imaging research and technological development. 
Analysis of medical big data in assessment and follow-up of personalised 
treatments has also become a major research topic in the area of precision 
medicine. In this review, current research trends in radiomics are analysed, 
from handcrafted radiomics feature extraction and statistical analysis to deep 
learning. Radiomics algorithms now include genomics and immunomics data to 
improve patient stratification and prediction of treatment response. Several 
applications have already shown conclusive results demonstrating the potential 
of including other "omics" data to existing imaging features. We also discuss 
further challenges of data harmonisation and management infrastructure to shed a 
light on the much-needed integration of radiomics and all other "omics" into 
clinical workflows. In particular, we point to the emerging paradigm shift in 
the implementation of big data infrastructures to facilitate databanks growth, 
data extraction and the development of expert software tools. Secured access, 
sharing, and integration of all health data, called "holomics", will accelerate 
the revolution of personalised medicine and oncology as well as expand the role 
of imaging specialists.

Precision medicine research designed to reduce health disparities often involves 
studying multi-level datasets to understand how diseases manifest 
disproportionately in one group over another, and how scarce health care 
resources can be directed precisely to those most at risk for disease. In this 
article, we provide a structured tutorial for medical and public health 
researchers on the application of machine learning methods to conduct precision 
medicine research designed to reduce health disparities. We review key terms and 
concepts for understanding machine learning papers, including supervised and 
unsupervised learning, regularization, cross-validation, bagging, and boosting. 
Metrics are reviewed for evaluating machine learners and major families of 
learning approaches, including tree-based learning, deep learning, and ensemble 
learning. We highlight the advantages and disadvantages of different learning 
approaches, describe strategies for interpreting "black box" models, and 
demonstrate the application of common methods in an example dataset with 
open-source statistical code in R.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers 
worldwide and its incidence is on the rise in many populations. The high 
incidence rate, late diagnosis, and improper treatment planning still form a 
significant concern. Diagnosis at an early-stage is important for better 
prognosis, treatment, and survival. Despite the recent improvement in the 
understanding of the molecular mechanisms, late diagnosis and approach toward 
precision medicine for OSCC patients remain a challenge. To enhance precision 
medicine, deep machine learning technique has been touted to enhance early 
detection, and consequently to reduce cancer-specific mortality and morbidity. 
This technique has been reported to have made a significant progress in data 
extraction and analysis of vital information in medical imaging in recent years. 
Therefore, it has the potential to assist in the early-stage detection of oral 
squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, automated image analysis can assist 
pathologists and clinicians to make an informed decision regarding cancer 
patients. This article discusses the technical knowledge and algorithms of deep 
learning for OSCC. It examines the application of deep learning technology in 
cancer detection, image classification, segmentation and synthesis, and 
treatment planning. Finally, we discuss how this technique can assist in 
precision medicine and the future perspective of deep learning technology in 
oral squamous cell carcinoma.

capable of identifying optimal treatment strategies for individual patients 
under substantial uncertainty. Here, we discuss the core components and 
challenges of such an approach and highlight the need for comprehensive 
longitudinal clinical and molecular data integration in its development. We 
describe the complementary and varied roles of mathematical modeling and machine 
learning in constructing dynamic optimal cancer treatment strategies and 
highlight the potential of reinforcement learning approaches in this endeavor.

The goal of precision medicine (individually tailored treatments) is not being 
achieved for neurobehavioural conditions such as psychiatric disorders. 
Traditional randomized clinical trial methods are insufficient for advancing 
precision medicine because of the dynamic complexity of these conditions. We 
present a pragmatic solution: the precision clinical trial framework, 
encompassing methods for individually tailored treatments. This framework 
includes the following: (1) treatment-targeted enrichment, which involves 
measuring patients' response after a brief bout of an intervention, and then 
randomizing patients to a full course of treatment, using the acute response to 
predict long-term outcomes; (2) adaptive treatments, which involve adjusting 
treatment parameters during the trial to individually optimize the treatment; 
and (3) precise measurement, which involves measuring predictor and outcome 
variables with high accuracy and reliability using techniques such as ecological 
momentary assessment. This review summarizes precision clinical trials and 
provides a research agenda, including new biomarkers such as precision 
neuroimaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalogram digital 
phenotyping and advances in statistical and machine-learning models. Validation 
of these approaches - and then widespread incorporation of the precision 
clinical trial framework - could help achieve the vision of precision medicine 
for neurobehavioural conditions.

Precision medicine is driven by the paradigm shift of empowering clinicians to 
predict the most appropriate course of action for patients with complex diseases 
and to improve routine medical and public health practice. Understanding 
patients' multi-omics make-up in conjunction with the clinical data will lead to 
determining predisposition, diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers and 
to optimal paths providing personalized care for diverse and targeted chronic, 
acute, and infectious diseases. Precision medicine promotes integrating 
collective and individualized clinical data with patient-specific multi-omics 
data to develop therapeutic strategies and knowledge bases for predictive and 
personalized medicine in diverse populations. Artificial intelligence approaches 
and machine learning algorithms will add additional capabilities to precision 
medicine that will leverage and extend the information contained within the 
original data and facilitate modeling patient-specific multi-omics data against 
publicly available annotation data for better understanding disease mechanisms. 
This chapter discusses emerging, significant, and recently reported multi-omics, 
deep phenotyping, and translational approaches to facilitate the implementation 
of precision medicine, as well as innovative, smart, and robust big-data 
platforms that are necessary to improve the quality and transition of healthcare 
by analyzing heterogeneous healthcare and multi-omics data.

Scholar databases to collect pertinent articles appearing up to 5 March 2021. 
Genetics, oncology, radiology, and the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
pandemic were chosen as representative fields addressing the cross-compliance of 
artificial intelligence (AI) and precision medicine based on the highest number 
of articles, topicality, and interconnectedness of the issue. Overall, we 
identified and perused 1572 articles. AI is a breakthrough that takes part in 
shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution in medicine and health care, changing 
the long-time accepted diagnostic and treatment regimens and approaches. 
AI-based link prediction models may be outstandingly helpful in the literature 
search for drug repurposing or finding new therapeutical modalities in rapidly 
erupting wide-scale diseases such as the recent COVID-19.

Life expectancy has gradually grown over the last century. This has deeply 
affected healthcare costs, since the growth of an aging population is correlated 
to the increasing burden of chronic diseases. This represents the interesting 
challenge of how to manage patients with chronic diseases in order to improve 
health care budgets. Effective primary prevention could represent a promising 
route. To this end, precision, together with personalized medicine, are useful 
instruments in order to investigate pathological processes before the appearance 
of clinical symptoms and to guide physicians to choose a targeted therapy to 
manage the patient. Cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases represent 
suitable models for taking full advantage of precision medicine technologies 
applied to all stages of disease development. The availability of high 
technology incorporating artificial intelligence and advancement progress made 
in the field of biomedical research have been substantial to understand how 
genes, epigenetic modifications, aging, nutrition, drugs, microbiome and other 
environmental factors can impact health and chronic disorders. The aim of the 
present review is to address how precision and personalized medicine can bring 
greater clarity to the clinical and biological complexity of these types of 
disorders associated with high mortality, involving tremendous health care 
costs, by describing in detail the methods that can be applied. This might offer 
precious tools for preventive strategies and possible clues on the evolution of 
the disease and could help in predicting morbidity, mortality and detecting 
chronic disease indicators much earlier in the disease course. This, of course, 
will have a major effect on both improving the quality of care and quality of 
life of the patients and reducing time efforts and healthcare costs.

BACKGROUND: Advances in omics and computational Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
have been said to be key to meeting the objectives of precision cardiovascular 
medicine. The focus of precision medicine includes a better assessment of 
disease risk and understanding of disease mechanisms. Our objective was to 
determine whether significant epigenetic changes occur in isolated, 
non-syndromic CoA. Further, we evaluated the AI analysis of DNA methylation for 
the prediction of CoA.
METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of newborn blood DNA was performed 
in 24 isolated, non-syndromic CoA cases and 16 controls using the Illumina 
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays. Cytosine nucleotide (CpG) methylation 
changes in CoA in each of 450,000 CpG loci were determined. Ingenuity pathway 
analysis (IPA) was performed to identify molecular and disease pathways that 
were epigenetically dysregulated. Using methylation data, six artificial 
intelligence (AI) platforms including deep learning (DL) was used for CoA 
detection.
RESULTS: We identified significant (FDR p-value ≤ .05) methylation changes in 65 
different CpG sites located in 75 genes in CoA subjects. DL achieved an AUC (95% 
CI) = 0.97 (0.80-1) with 95% sensitivity and 98% specificity. Gene ontology (GO) 
analysis yielded epigenetic alterations in important cardiovascular 
developmental genes and biological processes: abnormal morphology of 
cardiovascular system, left ventricular dysfunction, heart conduction disorder, 
thrombus formation, and coronary artery disease.
CONCLUSION: In an exploratory study we report the use of AI and epigenomics to 
achieve important objectives of precision cardiovascular medicine. Accurate 
prediction of CoA was achieved using a newborn blood spot. Further, we provided 
evidence of a significant epigenetic etiology in isolated CoA development.

Precision medicine is a new approach that considers differences in genes, 
environment, and lifestyle in an attempt to tailor treatments for individual 
patients. Psychiatry, as a discipline, has historically relied on clinical 
judgement and phenomenology-based diagnostic guidelines and has yet to take full 
advantage. This editorial provides an insight into the expanding role of 
precision medicine in psychiatry, both in research and clinical practice. It 
discusses the application of genetics and subgroup stratification in increasing 
response rates to therapeutic interventions, mainly focusing on major depressive 
disorder and schizophrenia. It presents an overview of machine learning 
techniques and how they are being integrated with traditional research methods 
within the field. In the context of these developments, while emphasizing the 
considerable potential for moving toward precision psychiatry, we also 
acknowledge the inherent challenges.

In recent years, radiomics, defined as the extraction of large amounts of 
quantitative features from medical images, has gained emerging interest. 
Radiomics consists of the extraction of handcrafted features combined with 
sophisticated statistical methods or machine learning algorithms for modelling, 
or deep learning algorithms that both learn features from raw data and perform 
modelling. These features have the potential to serve as non-invasive biomarkers 
for tumor characterization, prognostic stratification and response prediction, 
thereby contributing to precision medicine. However, especially in nuclear 
medicine, variable results are obtained when using radiomics for these purposes. 
Individual studies show promising results, but due to small numbers of patients 
per study and little standardization, it is difficult to compare and validate 
results on other datasets. This review describes the radiomic pipeline, its 
applications and the increasing role of artificial intelligence within the 
field. Furthermore, the challenges that need to be overcome to achieve clinical 
translation are discussed, so that, eventually, radiomics, combined with 
clinical data and other biomarkers, can contribute to precision medicine, by 
providing the right treatment to the right patient, with the right dose, at the 
right time.

BACKGROUND: The status of melancholia as a categorical or dimensional condition 
remains unclear, and no measure of melancholia has achieved definitive status. 
This study aimed to use a machine learning approach to assess whether a 
pre-established cut-off score on the Sydney Melancholia Prototype Index (SMPI) 
provided clear differentiation of melancholic/non-melancholic depression, and to 
identify the items making the most distinct contribution.
METHODS: We analysed amalgamated data sets of 1513 clinically depressed patients 
assessed via the clinician-rated version of the SMPI (SMPI-CR). We also 
evaluated the self-report version of the SMPI (SMPI-SR) in a combined 
clinical/community sample of 2025 depressed patients and senior high school 
students. Rule ensembles were derived in which the outcome measure was the 
presence/absence of melancholia (defined as scoring at or above a SMPI cut-off 
score that had been established in previous studies) and the predictive 
variables were the individual SMPI items.
RESULTS: The pre-established SMPI cut-off score was confirmed as differentiating 
melancholic/non-melancholic with near perfect accuracy for the SMPI-CR, and with 
very high accuracy for the SMPI-SR. The relative importance of all SMPI items 
was quantified.
LIMITATIONS: It is difficult to validate SMPI-assigned diagnoses due to the lack 
of any similar measures.
CONCLUSIONS: The SMPI-CR was confirmed to be a highly precise instrument for 
differentiating melancholic and non-melancholic depression. Its use will advance 
clinical decision making and studies evaluating causes, mechanisms and 
treatments for the two depressive sub-types, as well as assist clarification as 
to whether melancholia is categorically or dimensionally distinct from 
non-melancholic depression.

The complexity of orphan diseases, which are those that do not have an effective 
treatment, together with the high dimensionality of the genetic data used for 
their analysis and the high degree of uncertainty in the understanding of the 
mechanisms and genetic pathways which are involved in their development, 
motivate the use of advanced techniques of artificial intelligence and in-depth 
knowledge of molecular biology, which is crucial in order to find plausible 
solutions in drug design, including drug repositioning. Particularly, we show 
that the use of robust deep sampling methodologies of the altered genetics 
serves to obtain meaningful results and dramatically decreases the cost of 
research and development in drug design, influencing very positively the use of 
precision medicine and the outcomes in patients. The target-centric approach and 
the use of strong prior hypotheses that are not matched against reality (disease 
genetic data) are undoubtedly the cause of the high number of drug design 
failures and attrition rates. Sampling and prediction under uncertain conditions 
cannot be avoided in the development of precision medicine.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) relies upon a convergence of technologies with 
further synergies with life science technologies to capture the value of massive 
multi-modal data in the form of predictive models supporting decision-making. AI 
and machine learning (ML) enhance drug design and development by improving our 
understanding of disease heterogeneity, identifying dysregulated molecular 
pathways and therapeutic targets, designing and optimizing drug candidates, as 
well as evaluating in silico clinical efficacy. By providing an unprecedented 
level of knowledge on both patient specificities and drug candidate properties, 
AI is fostering the emergence of a computational precision medicine allowing the 
design of therapies or preventive measures tailored to the singularities of 
individual patients in terms of their physiology, disease features, and exposure 
to environmental risks.

Over the past two decades, biomedical research is moving toward a 
big-data-driven approach. The underlying causes of this transition include the 
ability to gather genetic or molecular profiles of humans faster, the increasing 
adoption of electronic health record (EHR) system, and the growing interest in 
linking omics and phenotypic data for analysis. The integration of individual's 
biology data (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics), and health-care data 
has created unprecedented opportunities for precision medicine, that is, a 
medical model that uses a patient's unique information, mainly genetic, to 
prevent, diagnose, or treat disease. This chapter reviewed the research 
opportunities and applications of integrating omics and phenotypic data for 
precision medicine, such as understanding the relationship between genotype and 
phenotype, disease subtyping, and diagnosis or prediction of adverse outcomes. 
We reviewed the recent advanced methods, particularly the machine learning and 
deep learning-based approaches used for harnessing and harmonizing the 
multiomics and phenotypic data to address these applications. We finally 
discussed the challenges and future directions.

While the term asthma has long been known to describe heterogeneous groupings of 
patients, only recently have data evolved which enable a molecular understanding 
of the clinical differences. The evolution of transcriptomics (and other 'omics 
platforms) and improved statistical analyses in combination with large clinical 
cohorts opened the door for molecular characterization of pathobiologic 
processes associated with a range of asthma patients. When linked with data from 
animal models and clinical trials of targeted biologic therapies, emerging 
distinctions arose between patients with and without elevations in type 2 immune 
and inflammatory pathways, leading to the confirmation of a broad categorization 
of type 2-Hi asthma. Differences in the ratios, sources, and location of type 2 
cytokines and their relation to additional immune pathway activation appear to 
distinguish several different (sub)molecular phenotypes, and perhaps endotypes 
of type 2-Hi asthma, which respond differently to broad and targeted 
anti-inflammatory therapies. Asthma in the absence of type 2 inflammation is 
much less well defined, without clear biomarkers, but is generally linked with 
poor responses to corticosteroids. Integration of "big data" from large cohorts, 
over time, using machine learning approaches, combined with validation and 
iterative learning in animal (and human) model systems is needed to identify the 
biomarkers and tightly defined molecular phenotypes/endotypes required to 
fulfill the promise of precision medicine.

Precision medicine is a medical approach to administer patients with a tailored 
dose of treatment by taking into consideration a person's variability in genes, 
environment, and lifestyles. The accumulation of omics big sequence data led to 
the development of various genetic databases on which clinical stratification of 
high-risk populations may be conducted. In addition, because cancers are 
generally caused by tumor-specific mutations, large-scale systematic 
identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in various tumors has 
propelled significant progress of tailored treatments of tumors (i.e., precision 
oncology). Machine learning (ML), a subfield of artificial intelligence in which 
computers learn through experience, has a great potential to be used in 
precision oncology chiefly to help physicians make diagnostic decisions based on 
tumor images. A promising venue of ML in precision oncology is the integration 
of all available data from images to multi-omics big data for the holistic care 
of patients and high-risk healthy subjects. In this review, we provide a focused 
overview of precision oncology and ML with attention to breast cancer and glioma 
as well as the Bayesian networks that have the flexibility and the ability to 
work with incomplete information. We also introduce some state-of-the-art 
attempts to use and incorporate ML and genetic information in precision 
oncology.

Estimating evapotranspiration (ET) has been one of the most critical research 
areas in agriculture because of water scarcity, the growing population, and 
climate change. The accurate estimation and mapping of ET are necessary for crop 
water management. Traditionally, researchers use water balance, soil moisture, 
weighing lysimeters, or an energy balance approach, such as Bowen ratio or eddy 
covariance towers to estimate ET. However, these ET methods are point-specific 
or area-weighted measurements and cannot be extended to a large scale. With the 
advent of satellite technology, remote sensing images became able to provide 
spatially distributed measurements. However, the spatial resolution of 
multispectral satellite images is in the range of meters, tens of meters, or 
hundreds of meters, which is often not enough for crops with clumped canopy 
structures, such as trees and vines. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can 
mitigate these spatial and temporal limitations. Lightweight cameras and sensors 
can be mounted on the UAVs and take high-resolution images. Unlike satellite 
imagery, the spatial resolution of the UAV images can be at the 
centimeter-level. UAVs can also fly on-demand, which provides high temporal 
imagery. In this study, the authors examined different UAV-based approaches of 
ET estimation at first. Models and algorithms, such as mapping 
evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC), 
the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model, and machine learning (ML) are 
analyzed and discussed herein. Second, challenges and opportunities for UAVs in 
ET estimation are also discussed, such as uncooled thermal camera calibration, 
UAV image collection, and image processing. Then, the authors share views on ET 
estimation with UAVs for future research and draw conclusive remarks.

BACKGROUND: In the real world, medical practice is changing hand in hand with 
the development of new Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and problems from 
different areas have been successfully solved using AI algorithms. Specifically, 
the use of AI techniques in setting up or building precision medicine is 
significant in terms of the accuracy of disease discovery and tailored 
treatment. Moreover, with the use of technology, clinical personnel can deliver 
a very much efficient healthcare service.
OBJECTIVE: This article reviews AI state-of-the-art in cardiovascular disease 
management, focusing on diagnostic and therapeutic improvements.
METHODS: To that end, we conducted a detailed PubMed search on AI application 
from distinct areas of cardiology: heart failure, arterial hypertension, atrial 
fibrillation, syncope and cardiovascular rehabilitation. Particularly, to assess 
the impact of these technologies in clinical decision-making, this research 
considers technical and medical aspects.
RESULTS: On one hand, some devices in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and 
cardiac rehabilitation represent an inexpensive, not invasive or not very 
invasive approach to long-term surveillance and management in these areas. On 
the other hand, the availability of large datasets (big data) is a useful tool 
to predict the development and outcome of many cardiovascular diseases. In 
summary, with this new guided therapy, the physician can supply prompt, 
individualised, and tailored treatment and the patients feel safe as they are 
continuously monitored, with a significant psychological effect.
CONCLUSION: Soon, tailored patient care via telemonitoring can improve clinical 
practice because AI-based systems support cardiologists in daily medical 
activities, improving disease detection and treatment. However, the 
physician-patient relationship remains a pivotal step.

The complexity of human cancer often results in significant heterogeneity in 
response to treatment. Precision medicine offers the potential to improve 
patient outcomes by leveraging this heterogeneity. Individualized treatment 
rules (ITRs) formalize precision medicine as maps from the patient covariate 
space into the space of allowable treatments. The optimal ITR is that which 
maximizes the mean of a clinical outcome in a population of interest. 
Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) studies permit the evaluation of multiple 
treatments within a single tumor, and thus are ideally suited for estimating 
optimal ITRs. PDX data are characterized by correlated outcomes, a 
high-dimensional feature space, and a large number of treatments. Here we 
explore machine learning methods for estimating optimal ITRs from PDX data. We 
analyze data from a large PDX study to identify biomarkers that are informative 
for developing personalized treatment recommendations in multiple cancers. We 
estimate optimal ITRs using regression-based (Q-learning) and direct-search 
methods (outcome weighted learning). Finally, we implement a superlearner 
approach to combine multiple estimated ITRs and show that the resulting ITR 
performs better than any of the input ITRs, mitigating uncertainty regarding 
user choice. Our results indicate that PDX data are a valuable resource for 
developing individualized treatment strategies in oncology. Supplementary 
materials for this article are available online.

The advancement of artificial intelligence concurrent with the development of 
medical imaging techniques provided a unique opportunity to turn medical imaging 
from mostly qualitative, to further quantitative and mineable data that can be 
explored for the development of clinical decision support systems (cDSS). 
Radiomics, a method for the high throughput extraction of hand-crafted features 
from medical images, and deep learning -the data driven modeling techniques 
based on the principles of simplified brain neuron interactions, are the most 
researched quantitative imaging techniques. Many studies reported on the 
potential of such techniques in the context of cDSS. Such techniques could be 
highly appealing due to the reuse of existing data, automation of clinical 
workflows, minimal invasiveness, three-dimensional volumetric characterization, 
and the promise of high accuracy and reproducibility of results and 
cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, there are several challenges that quantitative 
imaging techniques face, and need to be addressed before the translation to 
clinical use. These challenges include, but are not limited to, the 
explainability of the models, the reproducibility of the quantitative imaging 
features, and their sensitivity to variations in image acquisition and 
reconstruction parameters. In this narrative review, we report on the status of 
quantitative medical image analysis using radiomics and deep learning, the 
challenges the field is facing, propose a framework for robust radiomics 
analysis, and discuss future prospects.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized the field of artificial 
intelligence and have achieved unprecedented success in cognitive tasks such as 
image and speech recognition. Training of large DNNs, however, is 
computationally intensive and this has motivated the search for novel computing 
architectures targeting this application. A computational memory unit with 
nanoscale resistive memory devices organized in crossbar arrays could store the 
synaptic weights in their conductance states and perform the expensive weighted 
summations in place in a non-von Neumann manner. However, updating the 
conductance states in a reliable manner during the weight update process is a 
fundamental challenge that limits the training accuracy of such an 
implementation. Here, we propose a mixed-precision architecture that combines a 
computational memory unit performing the weighted summations and imprecise 
conductance updates with a digital processing unit that accumulates the weight 
updates in high precision. A combined hardware/software training experiment of a 
multilayer perceptron based on the proposed architecture using a phase-change 
memory (PCM) array achieves 97.73% test accuracy on the task of classifying 
handwritten digits (based on the MNIST dataset), within 0.6% of the software 
baseline. The architecture is further evaluated using accurate behavioral models 
of PCM on a wide class of networks, namely convolutional neural networks, 
long-short-term-memory networks, and generative-adversarial networks. Accuracies 
comparable to those of floating-point implementations are achieved without being 
constrained by the non-idealities associated with the PCM devices. A 
system-level study demonstrates 172 × improvement in energy efficiency of the 
architecture when used for training a multilayer perceptron compared with a 
dedicated fully digital 32-bit implementation.

Precision medicine is a new frontier in healthcare that uses scientific methods 
to customize medical treatment to the individual genes, anatomy, physiology, and 
lifestyle of each person. In cardiovascular health, precision medicine has 
emerged as a promising paradigm to enable cost-effective solutions that improve 
quality of life and reduce mortality rates. However, the exact role in precision 
medicine for human heart modeling has not yet been fully explored. Here, we 
discuss the challenges and opportunities for personalized human heart 
simulations, from diagnosis to device design, treatment planning, and prognosis. 
With a view toward personalization, we map out the history of anatomic, 
physical, and constitutive human heart models throughout the past three decades. 
We illustrate recent human heart modeling in electrophysiology, cardiac 
mechanics, and fluid dynamics and highlight clinically relevant applications of 
these models for drug development, pacing lead failure, heart failure, 
ventricular assist devices, edge-to-edge repair, and annuloplasty. With a view 
toward translational medicine, we provide a clinical perspective on virtual 
imaging trials and a regulatory perspective on medical device innovation. We 
show that precision medicine in human heart modeling does not necessarily 
require a fully personalized, high-resolution whole heart model with an entire 
personalized medical history. Instead, we advocate for creating personalized 
models out of population-based libraries with geometric, biological, physical, 
and clinical information by morphing between clinical data and medical histories 
from cohorts of patients using machine learning. We anticipate that this 
perspective will shape the path toward introducing human heart simulations into 
precision medicine with the ultimate goals to facilitate clinical decision 
making, guide treatment planning, and accelerate device design.

Oncologic visceral surgery has recently been revolutionized by robotics, 
artificial intelligence (AI), sparing of functionally important structures and 
innovative intraoperative imaging tools. These techniques enable new dimensions 
of precision surgery and oncology. Currently, data-driven, cognitive operating 
rooms are standing at the forefront of the latest technical and didactic 
developments in abdominal surgery. Rectal low anterior resection with total 
mesorectal excision (TME) for lower- and middle-third rectal cancer is a 
challenging operation due to the narrow pelvis and the tender guiding 
structures. Thus, new approaches have been needed to simplify the procedure and 
to upgrade the results. The combination of robotics with pelvic intraoperative 
neuromonitoring (pIONM) and new possibilities of visualization, such as multi- 
and hyperspectral imaging (MSI / HSI) or fluorescence imaging (FI) with 
indocyanine green (ICG) is a forward-looking modality to enhance surgical 
precision and reduce postoperative complications while improving oncologic and 
functional outcomes with a better quality of life. The aim of our video-paper is 
to show how to achieve maximum precision by combining robotic surgery with 
pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring and new imaging devices for rectal cancer.

In the field of theranostics, diagnostic nanoparticles are designed to collect 
highly patient-selective disease profiles, which is then leveraged by a set of 
nanotherapeutics to improve the therapeutic results. Despite their early 
promise, high interpatient and intratumoral heterogeneities make any rational 
design and analysis of these theranostics platforms extremely problematic. 
Recent advances in deep-learning-based tools may help bridge this gap, using 
pattern recognition algorithms for better diagnostic precision and therapeutic 
outcome. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a conundrum because of the 
complex molecular diversity, making its diagnosis and therapy challenging. To 
address these challenges, we propose a method to predict the cellular 
internalization of nanoparticles (NPs) against different cancer stages using 
artificial intelligence. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that a 
combination of machine-learning (ML) algorithm and characteristic cellular 
uptake responses for individual cancer cell types can be successfully used to 
classify various cancer cell types. Utilizing this approach, we can optimize the 
nanomaterials to get an optimum structure-internalization response for a given 
particle. This methodology predicted the structure-internalization response of 
the evaluated nanoparticles with remarkable accuracy (Q2 = 0.9). We anticipate 
that it can reduce the effort by minimizing the number of nanoparticles that 
need to be tested and could be utilized as a screening tool for designing 
nanotherapeutics. Following this, we have proposed a diagnostic 
nanomaterial-based platform used to assemble a patient-specific cancer profile 
with the assistance of machine learning (ML). The platform is composed of eight 
carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) with multifarious surface chemistries that can 
differentiate healthy breast cells from cancerous cells and then subclassify 
TNBC cells vs non-TNBC cells, within the TNBC group. The artificial neural 
network (ANN) algorithm has been successfully used in identifying the type of 
cancer cells from 36 unknown cancer samples with an overall accuracy of >98%, 
providing potential applications in cancer diagnostics.

Management of thyroid nodules in the era of precision medicine is continuously 
changing. Neck ultrasound plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and several 
ultrasound stratification systems have been proposed in order to predict 
malignancy and help clinicians in therapeutic and follow-up decision. Ultrasound 
elastosonography is another powerful diagnostic technique and can be an added 
value to stratify the risk of malignancy of thyroid nodules. Moreover, the 
development of new techniques in the era of "Deep Learning," has led to a 
creation of machine-learning algorithms based on ultrasound examinations that 
showed similar accuracy to that obtained by expert radiologists. Despite new 
technologies in thyroid imaging, diagnostic surgery in 50-70% of patients with 
indeterminate cytology is still performed. Molecular tests can increase accuracy 
in diagnosis when performed on "indeterminate" nodules. However, the more 
updated tools that can be used to this purpose in order to "rule out" (Afirma 
GSC) or "rule in" (Thyroseq v3) malignancy, have a main limitation: the high 
costs. In the last years various image-guided procedures have been proposed as 
alternative and less invasive approaches to surgery for symptomatic thyroid 
nodules. These minimally invasive techniques (laser and radio-frequency 
ablation, high intensity focused ultrasound and percutaneous microwave ablation) 
results in nodule shrinkage and improvement of local symptoms, with a lower risk 
of complications and minor costs compared to surgery. Finally, ultrasound-guided 
ablation therapy was introduced with promising results as a feasible treatment 
for low-risk papillary thyroid microcarcinoma or cervical lymph node metastases.

Precision medicine can be distilled into a concept of accounting for an 
individual's unique collection of clinical, physiologic, genetic, and 
sociodemographic characteristics to provide patient-level predictions of disease 
course and response to therapy. Abundant evidence now allows us to determine how 
an average person with epilepsy will respond to specific medical and surgical 
treatments. This is useful, but not readily applicable to an individual patient. 
This has brought into sharp focus the desire for a more individualized approach 
through which we counsel people based on individual characteristics, as opposed 
to population-level data. We are now accruing data at unprecedented rates, 
allowing us to convert this ideal into reality. In addition, we have access to 
growing volumes of administrative and electronic health records data, biometric, 
imaging, genetics data, microbiome, and other "omics" data, thus paving the way 
toward phenome-wide association studies and "the epidemiology of one." Despite 
this, there are many challenges ahead. The collating, integrating, and storing 
sensitive multimodal data for advanced analytics remains difficult as patient 
consent and data security issues increase in complexity. Agreement on many 
aspects of epilepsy remains imperfect, rendering models sensitive to 
misclassification due to a lack of "ground truth." Even with existing data, 
advanced analytics models are prone to overfitting and often failure to 
generalize externally. Finally, uptake by clinicians is often hindered by 
opaque, "black box" algorithms. Systematic approaches to data collection and 
model generation, and an emphasis on education to promote uptake and knowledge 
translation, are required to propel epilepsy-based precision medicine from the 
realm of the theoretical into routine clinical practice.

Precision psychiatry is an emerging field with transformative opportunities for 
mental health. However, the use of clinical prediction models carries 
unprecedented ethical challenges, which must be addressed before accessing the 
potential benefits of precision psychiatry. This critical review covers 
multidisciplinary areas, including psychiatry, ethics, statistics and 
machine-learning, healthcare and academia, as well as input from people with 
lived experience of mental disorders, their family, and carers. We aimed to 
identify core ethical considerations for precision psychiatry and mitigate 
concerns by designing a roadmap for research and clinical practice. We 
identified priorities: learning from somatic medicine; identifying precision 
psychiatry use cases; enhancing transparency and generalizability; fostering 
implementation; promoting mental health literacy; communicating risk estimates; 
data protection and privacy; and fostering the equitable distribution of mental 
health care. We hope this blueprint will advance research and practice and 
enable people with mental health problems to benefit from precision psychiatry.

The continued generation of large amounts of data within healthcare-from imaging 
to electronic medical health records to genomics and multi-omics -necessitates 
tools and methods to parse and interpret these data to improve healthcare 
outcomes. Artificial intelligence, and in particular deep learning, has enabled 
researchers to gain new insights from large scale and multimodal data. At the 
2022 Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) session entitled "Precision 
Medicine: Using Artificial Intelligence to Improve Diagnostics and Healthcare", 
we showcase the latest research, influenced and inspired by the idea of using 
technology to build a more fair, tailored, and cost-effective healthcare system 
after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The multitude of multi-omics data generated cost-effectively using advanced 
high-throughput technologies has imposed challenging domain for research in 
Artificial Intelligence (AI). Data curation poses a significant challenge as 
different parameters, instruments, and sample preparations approaches are 
employed for generating these big data sets. AI could reduce the fuzziness and 
randomness in data handling and build a platform for the data ecosystem, and 
thus serve as the primary choice for data mining and big data analysis to make 
informed decisions. However, AI implication remains intricate for 
researchers/clinicians lacking specific training in computational tools and 
informatics. Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide, accounting for an 
estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Certain cancers, such as pancreatic and 
gastric cancers, are detected only after they have reached their advanced stages 
with frequent relapses. Cancer is one of the most complex diseases affecting a 
range of organs with diverse disease progression mechanisms and the effectors 
ranging from gene-epigenetics to a wide array of metabolites. Hence a 
comprehensive study, including genomics, epi-genomics, transcriptomics, 
proteomics, and metabolomics, along with the medical/mass-spectrometry imaging, 
patient clinical history, treatments provided, genetics, and disease endemicity, 
is essential. Cancer Moonshot℠ Research Initiatives by NIH National Cancer 
Institute aims to collect as much information as possible from different regions 
of the world and make a cancer data repository. AI could play an immense role in 
(a) analysis of complex and heterogeneous data sets (multi-omics and/or 
inter-omics), (b) data integration to provide a holistic disease molecular 
mechanism, (c) identification of diagnostic and prognostic markers, and (d) 
monitor patient's response to drugs/treatments and recovery. AI enables 
precision disease management well beyond the prevalent disease stratification 
patterns, such as differential expression and supervised classification. This 
review highlights critical advances and challenges in omics data analysis, 
dealing with data variability from lab-to-lab, and data integration. We also 
describe methods used in data mining and AI methods to obtain robust results for 
precision medicine from "big" data. In the future, AI could be expanded to 
achieve ground-breaking progress in disease management.

With the completion of the International Human Genome Project, we have entered 
what is known as the post-genome era, and efforts to apply genomic information 
to medicine have become more active. In particular, with the announcement of the 
Precision Medicine Initiative by U.S. President Barack Obama in his State of the 
Union address at the beginning of 2015, "precision medicine," which aims to 
divide patients and potential patients into subgroups with respect to disease 
susceptibility, has become the focus of worldwide attention. The field of 
oncology is also actively adopting the precision oncology approach, which is 
based on molecular profiling, such as genomic information, to select the 
appropriate treatment. However, the current precision oncology is dominated by a 
method called targeted-gene panel (TGP), which uses next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) to analyze a limited number of specific cancer-related genes and suggest 
optimal treatments, but this method causes the problem that the number of 
patients who benefit from it is limited. In order to steadily develop precision 
oncology, it is necessary to integrate and analyze more detailed omics data, 
such as whole genome data and epigenome data. On the other hand, with the 
advancement of analysis technologies such as NGS, the amount of data obtained by 
omics analysis has become enormous, and artificial intelligence (AI) 
technologies, mainly machine learning (ML) technologies, are being actively used 
to make more efficient and accurate predictions. In this review, we will focus 
on whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis and epigenome analysis, introduce the 
latest results of omics analysis using ML technologies for the development of 
precision oncology, and discuss the future prospects.

Recent advancements in computational power, machine learning, and artificial 
intelligence technology have enabled automated evaluation of medical images to 
generate quantitative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Such objective 
biomarkers are readily available and have the potential to improve personalized 
treatment, precision medicine, and patient selection for clinical trials. In 
this article, we explore the merits of the most recent addition to the "-omics" 
concept for the broader field of head and neck cancer - "Radiomics". This review 
discusses radiomics studies focused on (molecular) characterization, 
classification, prognostication and treatment guidance for head and neck 
squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). We review the underlying hypothesis, general 
concept and typical workflow of radiomic analysis, and elaborate on current and 
future challenges to be addressed before routine clinical application.

Cancer is the second leading worldwide disease that depends on oncogenic 
mutations and non-mutated genes for survival. Recent advancements in 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) have transformed the health care sector with 
big data and machine learning (ML) approaches. NGS data are able to detect the 
abnormalities and mutations in the oncogenes. These multi-omics analyses are 
used for risk prediction, early diagnosis, accurate prognosis, and 
identification of biomarkers in cancer patients. The availability of these 
cancer data and their analysis may provide insights into the biology of the 
disease, which can be used for the personalized treatment of cancer patients. 
Bioinformatics tools are delivering this promise by managing, integrating, and 
analyzing these complex datasets. The clinical outcomes of cancer patients are 
improved by the use of various innovative methods implicated particularly for 
diagnosis and therapeutics. ML-based artificial intelligence (AI) applications 
are solving these issues to a great extent. AI techniques are used to update the 
patients on a personalized basis about their treatment procedures, progress, 
recovery, therapies used, dietary changes in lifestyles patterns along with the 
survival summary of previously recovered cancer patients. In this way, the 
patients are becoming more aware of their diseases and the entire clinical 
treatment procedures. Though the technology has its own advantages and 
disadvantages, we hope that the day is not so far when AI techniques will 
provide personalized treatment to cancer patients tailored to their needs in 
much quicker ways.

OBJECTIVES: Conduct a survey of the literature for advancements in cancer 
informatics over the last three years in three specific areas where there has 
been unprecedented growth: 1) digital health; 2) machine learning; and 3) 
precision oncology. We also highlight the ethical implications and future 
opportunities within each area.
METHODS: A search was conducted over a three-year period in two electronic 
databases (PubMed, Google Scholar) to identify peer-reviewed articles and 
conference proceedings. Search terms included variations of the following: 
neoplasms[MeSH], informatics[MeSH], cancer, oncology, clinical cancer 
informatics, medical cancer informatics. The search returned too many articles 
for practical review (23,994 from PubMed and 23,100 from Google Scholar). Thus, 
we conducted searches of key PubMed-indexed informatics journals and 
proceedings. We further limited our search to manuscripts that demonstrated a 
clear focus on clinical or translational cancer informatics. Manuscripts were 
then selected based on their methodological rigor, scientific impact, 
innovation, and contribution towards cancer informatics as a field or on their 
impact on cancer care and research.
RESULTS: Key developments and opportunities in cancer informatics research in 
the areas of digital health, machine learning, and precision oncology were 
summarized.
CONCLUSION: While there are numerous innovations in the field of cancer 
informatics to advance prevention and clinical care, considerable challenges 
remain related to data sharing and privacy, digital accessibility, and algorithm 
biases and interpretation. The implementation and application of these findings 
in cancer care necessitates further consideration and research.

Healthcare is undergoing a transformation, and it is imperative to leverage new 
technologies to generate new data and support the advent of precision medicine 
(PM). Recent scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements have 
improved our understanding of disease pathogenesis and changed the way we 
diagnose and treat disease leading to more precise, predictable and powerful 
health care that is customized for the individual patient. Genetic, genomics, 
and epigenetic alterations appear to be contributing to different diseases. Deep 
clinical phenotyping, combined with advanced molecular phenotypic profiling, 
enables the construction of causal network models in which a genomic region is 
proposed to influence the levels of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. 
Phenotypic analysis bears great importance to elucidat the pathophysiology of 
networks at the molecular and cellular level. Digital biomarkers (BMs) can have 
several applications beyond clinical trials in diagnostics-to identify patients 
affected by a disease or to guide treatment. Digital BMs present a big 
opportunity to measure clinical endpoints in a remote, objective and unbiased 
manner. However, the use of "omics" technologies and large sample sizes have 
generated massive amounts of data sets, and their analyses have become a major 
bottleneck requiring sophisticated computational and statistical methods. With 
the wealth of information for different diseases and its link to intrinsic 
biology, the challenge is now to turn the multi-parametric taxonomic 
classification of a disease into better clinical decision-making by more 
precisely defining a disease. As a result, the big data revolution has provided 
an opportunity to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning 
algorithms to this vast data set. The advancements in digital health 
opportunities have also arisen numerous questions and concerns on the future of 
healthcare practices in particular with what regards the reliability of AI 
diagnostic tools, the impact on clinical practice and vulnerability of 
algorithms. AI, machine learning algorithms, computational biology, and digital 
BMs will offer an opportunity to translate new data into actionable information 
thus, allowing earlier diagnosis and precise treatment options. A better 
understanding and cohesiveness of the different components of the knowledge 
network is a must to fully exploit the potential of it.

Purpose.Accurate neuroelectrode placement is essential to effective monitoring 
or stimulation of neurosurgery targets. This work presents and evaluates a 
method that combines deep learning and model-based deformable 3D-2D registration 
to guide and verify neuroelectrode placement using intraoperative 
imaging.Methods.The registration method consists of three stages: (1) detection 
of neuroelectrodes in a pair of fluoroscopy images using a deep learning 
approach; (2) determination of correspondence and initial 3D localization among 
neuroelectrode detections in the two projection images; and (3) deformable 3D-2D 
registration of neuroelectrodes according to a physical device model. The method 
was evaluated in phantom, cadaver, and clinical studies in terms of (a) the 
accuracy of neuroelectrode registration and (b) the quality of metal artifact 
reduction (MAR) in cone-beam CT (CBCT) in which the deformably registered 
neuroelectrode models are taken as input to the MAR.Results.The combined deep 
learning and model-based deformable 3D-2D registration approach achieved 
0.2 ± 0.1 mm accuracy in cadaver studies and 0.6 ± 0.3 mm accuracy in clinical 
studies. The detection network and 3D correspondence provided initialization of 
3D-2D registration within 2 mm, which facilitated end-to-end registration 
runtime within 10 s. Metal artifacts, quantified as the standard deviation in 
voxel values in tissue adjacent to neuroelectrodes, were reduced by 72% in 
phantom studies and by 60% in first clinical studies.Conclusions.The method 
combines the speed and generalizability of deep learning (for initialization) 
with the precision and reliability of physical model-based registration to 
achieve accurate deformable 3D-2D registration and MAR in functional 
neurosurgery. Accurate 3D-2D guidance from fluoroscopy could overcome 
limitations associated with deformation in conventional navigation, and improved 
MAR could improve CBCT verification of neuroelectrode placement.

While multi-level molecular "omic" analyses have undoubtedly increased the 
sophistication and depth with which we can understand cancer biology, the 
challenge is to make this overwhelming wealth of data relevant to the clinician 
and the individual patient. Bridging this gap serves as the cornerstone of 
precision medicine, yet the expense and difficulty of executing and interpreting 
these molecular studies make it impractical to routinely implement them in the 
clinical setting. Herein, we propose that machine learning may hold the key to 
guiding the future of precision oncology accurately and efficiently. Training 
deep learning models to interpret the histopathologic or radiographic appearance 
of tumors and their microenvironment-a phenotypic microcosm of their inherent 
molecular biology-has the potential to output relevant diagnostic, prognostic, 
and therapeutic patient-level data. This type of artificial intelligence 
framework may effectively shape the future of precision oncology by fostering 
multidisciplinary collaboration.

The assessment of DNA damage can be a significant diagnostic for precision 
medicine. DNA double strand break (DSBs) pathways in cancer are the primary 
targets in a majority of anticancer therapies, yet the molecular vulnerabilities 
that underlie each tumor can vary widely making the application of precision 
medicine challenging. Identifying and understanding these interindividual 
vulnerabilities enables the design of targeted DSB inhibitors along with 
evolving precision medicine approaches to selectively kill cancer cells with 
minimal side effects. A major challenge however, is defining exactly how to 
target unique differences in DSB repair pathway mechanisms. This review 
comprises a brief overview of the DSB repair mechanisms in cancer and includes 
results obtained with revolutionary advances such as CRISPR/Cas9 and machine 
learning/artificial intelligence, which are rapidly advancing not only our 
understanding of determinants of DSB repair choice, but also how it can be used 
to advance precision medicine. Scientific innovation in the methods used to 
diagnose and treat cancer is converging with advances in basic science and 
translational research. This revolution will continue to be a critical driver of 
precision medicine that will enable precise targeting of unique individual 
mechanisms. This review aims to lay the foundation for achieving this goal.

Advances in computerized image analysis and the use of artificial 
intelligence-based approaches for image-based analysis and construction of 
prediction algorithms represent a new era for noninvasive biomarker discovery. 
In recent literature, it has become apparent that radiologic images can serve as 
mineable databases that contain large amounts of quantitative features with 
potential clinical significance. Extraction and analysis of these quantitative 
features is commonly referred to as texture or radiomic analysis. Numerous 
studies have demonstrated applications for texture and radiomic characterization 
methods for assessing brain tumors to improve noninvasive predictions of tumor 
histologic characteristics, molecular profile, distinction of treatment-related 
changes, and prediction of patient survival. In this review, the current use and 
future potential of texture or radiomic-based approaches with machine learning 
for brain tumor image analysis and prediction algorithm construction will be 
discussed. This technology has the potential to advance the value of diagnostic 
imaging by extracting currently unused information on medical scans that enables 
more precise, personalized therapy; however, significant barriers must be 
overcome if this technology is to be successfully implemented on a wide scale 
for routine use in the clinical setting. Keywords: Adults and Pediatrics,

Artificial intelligence, or the discipline of developing computational 
algorithms able to perform tasks that requires human intelligence, offers the 
opportunity to improve our idea and delivery of precision medicine. Here, we 
provide an overview of artificial intelligence approaches for the analysis of 
large-scale RNA-sequencing datasets in cancer. We present the major solutions to 
disentangle inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of transcriptome profiles for 
an effective improvement of patient management. We outline the contributions of 
learning algorithms to the needs of cancer genomics, from identifying rare 
cancer subtypes to personalizing therapeutic treatments.

In cell and molecular biology, metabolism is the only system that can be fully 
simulated at genome scale. Metabolic systems biology offers powerful abstraction 
tools to simulate all known metabolic reactions in a cell, therefore providing a 
snapshot that is close to its observable phenotype. In this review, we cover the 
15 years of human metabolic modelling. We show that, although the past five 
years have not experienced large improvements in the size of the gene and 
metabolite sets in human metabolic models, their accuracy is rapidly increasing. 
We also describe how condition-, tissue-, and patient-specific metabolic models 
shed light on cell-specific changes occurring in the metabolic network, 
therefore predicting biomarkers of disease metabolism. We finally discuss 
current challenges and future promising directions for this research field, 
including machine/deep learning and precision medicine. In the omics era, 
profiling patients and biological processes from a multiomic point of view is 
becoming more common and less expensive. Starting from multiomic data collected 
from patients and N-of-1 trials where individual patients constitute different 
case studies, methods for model-building and data integration are being used to 
generate patient-specific models. Coupled with state-of-the-art machine learning 
methods, this will allow characterizing each patient's disease phenotype and 
delivering precision medicine solutions, therefore leading to preventative 
medicine, reduced treatment, and in silico clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Precision medicine development is driven by the possibilities of 
next generation sequencing, information technology and artificial intelligence 
and thus, raises a number of ethical questions. Empirical studies have 
investigated such issues from the perspectives of health care professionals, 
researchers and patients. We synthesize the results from these studies in this 
review.
METHODS: We used a systematic strategy to search, screen and assess the 
literature for eligibility related to our research question. The initial search 
for empirical studies in five data bases provided 665 different records and we 
selected 92 of these publications for inclusion in this review. Data were 
extracted in a spreadsheet and categorized into different topics representing 
the views on ethical issues in precision medicine.
RESULTS: Many patients and professionals expect high benefits from precision 
medicine and have a positive attitude towards it. However, patients and 
professionals also perceive some risks. Commonly perceived risks include: lack 
of evidence for accuracy of tests and efficacy of treatments; limited knowledge 
of patients, which makes informed consent more difficult; possible 
unavailability of access to precision medicine for underprivileged people and 
ethnic minorities; misuse of data by insurance companies and employers, 
potential of racial stigmatization due to genetic information; unwanted 
communication of incidental findings; changes in doctor-patient-relationship 
through focusing on data; and the problem that patients could feel under 
pressure to optimize their health.
CONCLUSIONS: National legislation and guidelines already minimize many risks 
associated with precision medicine. However, from our perspective some problems 
require more attention. Should hopes for precision medicine's benefits be 
fulfilled, then the ethical principle of justice would require an unlimited 
access to precision medicine for all people. The potential for autonomous 
patients' decisions must be greatly enhanced by improvements in patient 
education. Harm from test results must be avoided in any case by the highest 
possible data security level and communication guidelines. Changes in the 
doctor-patient relationship and the impact of precision medicine on the quality 
of life should be further investigated. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of 
precision medicine should be further examined, in order to avoid malinvestment.

Personalized medicine is among the most exciting innovations in recent clinical 
research, offering the opportunity for tailored screening and management at the 
individual level. Biomarker-enriched clinical trials have shown increased 
efficiency and informativeness in cancer research due to the selective exclusion 
of patients unlikely to benefit. In acute stress situations, clinically 
significant decisions are often made in time-sensitive manners and providers may 
be pressed to make decisions based on abbreviated clinical assessments. Up to 
30% of trauma survivors admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) will develop 
long-lasting posttraumatic stress psychopathologies. The long-term impact of 
those survivors with posttraumatic stress sequelae are significant, impacting 
both long-term psychological and physiological recovery. An accurate prognostic 
model of who will develop posttraumatic stress symptoms does not exist yet. 
Additionally, no scalable and cost-effective method that can be easily 
integrated into routine care exists, even though especially the acute care 
setting provides a critical window of opportunity for prevention in the 
so-called golden hours when preventive measures are most effective. In this 
review, we aim to discuss emerging machine learning (ML) applications that are 
promising for precisely risk stratification and targeted treatments in the acute 
care setting. The aim of this narrative review is to present examples of digital 
health innovations and to discuss the potential of these new approaches for 
treatment selection and prevention of posttraumatic sequelae in the acute care 
setting. The application of artificial intelligence-based solutions have already 
had great success in other areas and are rapidly approaching the field of 
psychological care as well. New ways of algorithm-based risk predicting, and the 
use of digital phenotypes provide a high potential for predicting future risk of 
PTSD in acute care settings and to go new steps in precision psychiatry.

Precision medicine aims to empower clinicians to predict the most appropriate 
course of action for patients with complex diseases like cancer, diabetes, 
cardiomyopathy, and COVID-19. With a progressive interpretation of the clinical, 
molecular, and genomic factors at play in diseases, more effective and 
personalized medical treatments are anticipated for many disorders. 
Understanding patient's metabolomics and genetic make-up in conjunction with 
clinical data will significantly lead to determining predisposition, diagnostic, 
prognostic, and predictive biomarkers and paths ultimately providing optimal and 
personalized care for diverse, and targeted chronic and acute diseases. In 
clinical settings, we need to timely model clinical and multi-omics data to find 
statistical patterns across millions of features to identify underlying biologic 
pathways, modifiable risk factors, and actionable information that support early 
detection and prevention of complex disorders, and development of new therapies 
for better patient care. It is important to calculate quantitative phenotype 
measurements, evaluate variants in unique genes and interpret using ACMG 
guidelines, find frequency of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants without 
disease indicators, and observe autosomal recessive carriers with a phenotype 
manifestation in metabolome. Next, ensuring security to reconcile noise, we need 
to build and train machine-learning prognostic models to meaningfully process 
multisource heterogeneous data to identify high-risk rare variants and make 
medically relevant predictions. The goal, today, is to facilitate implementation 
of mainstream precision medicine to improve the traditional symptom-driven 
practice of medicine, and allow earlier interventions using predictive 
diagnostics and tailoring better-personalized treatments. We strongly recommend 
automated implementation of cutting-edge technologies, utilizing machine 
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for the multimodal 
data aggregation, multifactor examination, development of knowledgebase of 
clinical predictors for decision support, and best strategies for dealing with 
relevant ethical issues.

A main goal of Precision Medicine is that of incorporating and integrating the 
vast corpora on different databases about the molecular and environmental 
origins of disease, into analytic frameworks, allowing the development of 
individualized, context-dependent diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches. In 
this regard, artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches can be used 
to build analytical models of complex disease aimed at prediction of 
personalized health conditions and outcomes. Such models must handle the wide 
heterogeneity of individuals in both their genetic predisposition and their 
social and environmental determinants. Computational approaches to medicine need 
to be able to efficiently manage, visualize and integrate, large datasets 
combining structure, and unstructured formats. This needs to be done while 
constrained by different levels of confidentiality, ideally doing so within a 
unified analytical architecture. Efficient data integration and management is 
key to the successful application of computational intelligence approaches to 
medicine. A number of challenges arise in the design of successful designs to 
medical data analytics under currently demanding conditions of performance in 
personalized medicine, while also subject to time, computational power, and 
bioethical constraints. Here, we will review some of these constraints and 
discuss possible avenues to overcome current challenges.

Skeletal muscle injury provokes a regenerative response, characterized by the de 
novo generation of myofibers that are distinguished by central nucleation and 
re-expression of developmentally restricted genes. In addition to these 
characteristics, myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) is widely used to evaluate 
muscle hypertrophic and regenerative responses. Here, we introduce QuantiMus, a 
free software program that uses machine learning algorithms to quantify muscle 
morphology and molecular features with high precision and quick processing-time. 
The ability of QuantiMus to define and measure myofibers was compared to manual 
measurement or other automated software programs. QuantiMus rapidly and 
accurately defined total myofibers and measured CSA with comparable performance 
but quantified the CSA of centrally-nucleated fibers (CNFs) with greater 
precision compared to other software. It additionally quantified the 
fluorescence intensity of individual myofibers of human and mouse muscle, which 
was used to assess the distribution of myofiber type, based on the myosin heavy 
chain isoform that was expressed. Furthermore, analysis of entire quadriceps 
cross-sections of healthy and mdx mice showed that dystrophic muscle had an 
increased frequency of Evans blue dye+ injured myofibers. QuantiMus also 
revealed that the proportion of centrally nucleated, regenerating myofibers that 
express embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMyHC) or neural cell adhesion molecule 
(NCAM) were increased in dystrophic mice. Our findings reveal that QuantiMus has 
several advantages over existing software. The unique self-learning capacity of 
the machine learning algorithms provides superior accuracy and the ability to 
rapidly interrogate the complete muscle section. These qualities increase rigor 
and reproducibility by avoiding methods that rely on the sampling of 
representative areas of a section. This is of particular importance for the 
analysis of dystrophic muscle given the "patchy" distribution of muscle 
pathology. QuantiMus is an open source tool, allowing customization to meet 
investigator-specific needs and provides novel analytical approaches for 
quantifying muscle morphology.

In 2016, the World Innovation Summit for Health (WISH) published its Forum 
Report on precision medicine "PRECISION MEDICINE - A GLOBAL ACTION PLAN FOR 
IMPACT". Healthcare is undergoing a transformation, and it is imperative to 
leverage new technologies to generate new data and support the advent of 
precision medicine (PM). Recent scientific breakthroughs and technological 
advancements have improved our disease knowledge and altered diagnosis and 
treatment approaches resulting in a more precise, predictive, preventative and 
personalized health care that is customized for the individual patient. 
Consequently, the big data revolution has provided an opportunity to apply 
artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to mine such a vast data 
set. Additionally, personalized medicine promises to revolutionize healthcare, 
with its key goal of providing the right treatment to the right patient at the 
right time and dose, and thus the potential of improving quality of life and 
helping to bring down healthcare costs.This policy briefing will look in detail 
at the issues surrounding continued development, sustained investment, risk 
factors, testing and approval of innovations for better strategy and faster 
process. The paper will serve as a policy bridge that is required to enhance a 
conscious decision among the powers-that-be in Qatar in order to find a way to 
harmonize multiple strands of activity and responsibility in the health arena. 
The end goal will be for Qatar to enhance public awareness and engagement and to 
integrate effectively the incredible advances in research into healthcare 
systems, for the benefit of all patients.The PM policy briefing provides 
concrete recommendations on moving forward with PM initiatives in Qatar and 
internationally. Equally important, integration of PM within a primary care 
setting, building a coalition of community champions through awareness and 
advocacy, finally, communicating PM value, patient engagement/empowerment and 
education/continued professional development programs of the healthcare 
workforce.Key recommendations for implementation of precision medicine inside 
and outside Qatar: 1. Create Community Awareness and PM Education Programs 2. 
Engage and Empower Patients 3. Communicate PM Value 4. Develop appropriate 
Infrastructure and Information Management Systems 5. Integrate PM into standard 
Healthcare System and Ensure Access to Care PM is no longer futuristic. It is 
here. Implementing PM in routine clinical care does require some investment and 
infrastructure development. Invariably, cost and lack of expertise are cited as 
barriers to PM implementation. Equally consequential, are the curriculum and 
professional development of medical care experts.Policymakers need to lead and 
coordinate effort among stakeholders and consider cultural and faith 
perspectives to ensure success. It is essential that policymakers integrate PM 
approaches into national strategies to improve health and health care for all, 
and to drive towards the future of medicine precision health.

The rapid growth and decreasing cost of Next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
technologies have made it possible to conduct routine large panel genomic 
sequencing in many disease settings, especially in the oncology domain. 
Furthermore, it is now known that optimal disease management of patients depends 
on individualized cancer treatment guided by comprehensive molecular testing. 
However, translating results from molecular sequencing reports into actionable 
clinical insights remains a challenge to most clinicians. In this review, we 
discuss about some representative systems that leverage artificial intelligence 
(AI) to facilitate some processes of clinicians' decision making based upon 
molecular data, focusing on their application in precision oncology. Some 
limitations and pitfalls of the current application of AI in clinical decision 
making are also discussed.

Precision medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment for an 
individual based on large amounts of biologic and extrinsic data. The fast 
advancing fields of molecular biology, gene sequencing, machine learning, and 
other technologies enable precision medicine to utilize this detailed 
information to enhance clinical management decision-making for an individual in 
the real time of the disease course. Traditional clinical decision making is 
based on reacting to a relatively limited number of phenotypes that are 
determined by history, physical examination, and conventional lab tests. 
Precision medicine depends on highly detailed profiling of the patient's 
genetic, morphologic, and metabolic makeup. The precision medicine approach can 
be applied to individuals with diabetes to select treatments most likely to 
offer benefit and least likely to cause side effects, offering prospects of 
improved clinical outcomes and economic costs savings over current empiric 
practices. As genetic, metabolomic, immunologic, and other sophisticated testing 
becomes less expensive and more widespread in the medical record, it is expected 
that precision medicine will become increasingly applied to diabetes care.

Rapid technological advances in non-invasive imaging, coupled with the 
availability of large data sets and the expansion of computational models and 
power, have revolutionized the role of imaging in medicine. Non-invasive imaging 
is the pillar of modern cardiovascular diagnostics, with modalities such as 
cardiac computed tomography (CT) now recognized as first-line options for 
cardiovascular risk stratification and the assessment of stable or even unstable 
patients. To date, cardiovascular imaging has lagged behind other fields, such 
as oncology, in the clinical translational of artificial intelligence (AI)-based 
approaches. We hereby review the current status of AI in non-invasive 
cardiovascular imaging, using cardiac CT as a running example of how novel 
machine learning (ML)-based radiomic approaches can improve clinical care. The 
integration of ML, deep learning, and radiomic methods has revealed direct links 
between tissue imaging phenotyping and tissue biology, with important clinical 
implications. More specifically, we discuss the current evidence, strengths, 
limitations, and future directions for AI in cardiac imaging and CT, as well as 
lessons that can be learned from other areas. Finally, we propose a scientific 
framework in order to ensure the clinical and scientific validity of future 
studies in this novel, yet highly promising field. Still in its infancy, 
AI-based cardiovascular imaging has a lot to offer to both the patients and 
their doctors as it catalyzes the transition towards a more precise phenotyping 
of cardiovascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer (LC) is a leading cause of cancer-deaths globally. Its 
lethality is due in large part to the paucity of accurate screening markers. 
Precision Medicine includes the use of omics technology and novel analytic 
approaches for biomarker development. We combined Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
and DNA methylation analysis of circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA), to 
identify putative biomarkers for and to elucidate the pathogenesis of LC.
METHODS: Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array analysis was used to 
measure cytosine (CpG) methylation changes across the genome in LC. Six 
different AI platforms including support vector machine (SVM) and Deep Learning 
(DL) were used to identify CpG biomarkers and for LC detection. Training set and 
validation sets were generated, and 10-fold cross validation performed. Gene 
enrichment analysis using g:profiler and GREAT enrichment was used to elucidate 
the LC pathogenesis.
RESULTS: Using a stringent GWAS significance threshold, p-value <5x10-8, we 
identified 4389 CpGs (cytosine methylation loci) in coding genes and 1812 CpGs 
in non-protein coding DNA regions that were differentially methylated in LC. SVM 
and three other AI platforms achieved an AUC=1.00; 95% CI (0.90-1.00) for LC 
detection. DL achieved an AUC=1.00; 95% CI (0.95-1.00) and 100% sensitivity and 
specificity. High diagnostic accuracies were achieved with only intragenic or 
only intergenic CpG loci. Gene enrichment analysis found dysregulation of 
molecular pathways involved in the development of small cell and non-small cell 
LC.
CONCLUSION: Using AI and DNA methylation analysis of ctDNA, high LC detection 
rates were achieved. Further, many of the genes that were epigenetically altered 
are known to be involved in the biology of neoplasms in general and lung cancer 
in particular.

BACKGROUND: The global alliance for genomics and healthcare facilities provides 
innovative solutions to expedite research and clinical practices for complex and 
incurable health conditions. Precision oncology is an emerging field explicitly 
tailored to facilitate cancer diagnosis, prevention, and treatment based on 
patients' genetic profiles. Advancements in "omics" techniques, next-generation 
sequencing, artificial intelligence, and clinical trial designs provide a 
platform for assessing the efficacy and safety of combination therapies and 
diagnostic procedures.
METHODS: Data were collected from PubMed and Google Scholar using keywords 
"Precision medicine," "precision medicine and cancer," "anticancer agents in 
precision medicine," and reviewed comprehensively.
RESULTS: Personalized therapeutics, including immunotherapy and cancer vaccines, 
serve as a groundbreaking solution for cancer treatment. Herein, we take a 
measurable view of precision therapies and novel diagnostic approaches targeting 
cancer treatment. The contemporary applications of precision medicine have also 
been described, along with various hurdles identified in the successful 
establishment of precision therapeutics.
CONCLUSION: This review highlights the key breakthroughs related to 
immunotherapies, targeted anticancer agents, and target interventions related to 
cancer signaling mechanisms. The success story of this field in context to drug 
resistance, safety, patient survival, and improving quality of life is yet to be 
elucidated. We conclude that, in the near future, the field of individualized 
treatments may truly revolutionize the nature of cancer patient care.

Precision medicine in oncology uses genomic data to provide the right 
intervention in the right patients at the right time. For this purpose, 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an indispensable tool. However, further 
innovations are necessary, including medical informatics which uses somatic 
mutations to inform clinical intervention. This process, called manual 
interpretation or curation, is currently labor-intensive, involving experienced 
curators who identify the relevant evidence among a growing body of knowledge 
and translate it into medical practice. To address this issue, since 2015, we 
have been organizing a clinical sequencing (CS) team, which integrates clinical 
and genomic information related to hematological malignancies with the aid of 
artificial intelligence (AI). So far, we have collated AI-assisted CS data for 
more than 300 patients with hematological cancers. In this paper, we provide a 
brief introduction for the nonspecialist to the manual interpretation process 
together with an overview of a representative AI platform, Watson for Genomics. 
Based on our own experience, we highlight why AI is needed in the manual 
interpretation process in CS. We also present some of the pitfalls and 
limitations of AI that hematologists should be aware of when interpreting 
AI-output.

Precision pathological diagnosis plays a vital role in precision medicine. Both 
the limited resources available to pathologists and the incessant demands for 
further refinement and quantification of clinical diagnosis are posing new 
challenges for pathologists to meet the needs for precision pathological 
diagnosis. It is expected that artificial intelligence (AI) will be the powerful 
tool that will help find solutions to this problem from different angles. The 
author of this article elaborated on a number of ways in which AI can help 
promote precision pathological diagnosis, including AI-assisted precision 
extraction of tissue samples, AI-assisted precision histopathologic diagnosis, 
AI-assisted histological grading and quantitative scoring, AI-assisted precision 
assessment of tumor biomarkers, AI-assisted prediction of molecular features and 
precision interpretation of biological information based on hematoxylin-eosin 
(HE) stained images, the realization of in-depth precision diagnosis based on 
AI-assisted information integration, and AI-assisted accurate prediction of 
patient survival and prognosis based on HE-stained images. The paper presents to 
the readers the future of smart pathology that AI will help usher in.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article discusses the advances, methods, challenges, and 
future directions of data-driven methods in advancing precision oncology for 
biomedical research, drug discovery, clinical research, and practice.
RECENT FINDINGS: Precision oncology provides individually tailored cancer 
treatment by considering an individual's genetic makeup, clinical, 
environmental, social, and lifestyle information. Challenges include voluminous, 
heterogeneous, and disparate data generated by different technologies with 
multiple modalities such as Omics, electronic health records, clinical 
registries and repositories, medical imaging, demographics, wearables, and 
sensors. Statistical and machine learning methods have been continuously 
adapting to the ever-increasing size and complexity of data. Precision Oncology 
supportive analytics have improved turnaround time in biomarker discovery and 
time-to-application of new and repurposed drugs. Precision oncology additionally 
seeks to identify target patient populations based on genomic alterations that 
are sensitive or resistant to conventional or experimental treatments. 
Predictive models have been developed for cancer progression and survivorship, 
drug sensitivity and resistance, and identification of the most suitable 
combination treatments for individual patient scenarios. In the future, clinical 
decision support systems need to be revamped to better incorporate knowledge 
from precision oncology, thus enabling clinical practitioners to provide 
precision cancer care.
SUMMARY: Open Omics datasets, machine learning algorithms, and predictive models 
have enabled the advancement of precision oncology. Clinical decision support 
systems with integrated electronic health record and Omics data are needed to 
provide data-driven recommendations to assist clinicians in disease prevention, 
early identification, and individualized treatment. Additionally, as cancer is a 
constantly evolving disorder, clinical decision systems will need to be 
continually updated based on more recent knowledge and datasets.

The circulating cell-free nucleic acids (ccfNAs) are a mixture of single- or 
double-stranded nucleic acids, released into the blood plasma/serum by different 
tissues via apoptosis, necrosis, and secretions. Under healthy conditions, 
ccfNAs originate from the hematopoietic system, whereas under various clinical 
scenarios, the concomitant tissues release ccfNAs into the bloodstream. These 
ccfNAs include DNA, RNA, microRNA (miRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), fetal 
DNA/RNA, and mitochondrial DNA/RNA, and act as potential biomarkers in various 
clinical conditions. These are associated with different epigenetic 
modifications, which show disease-related variations and so finding their role 
as epigenetic biomarkers in clinical settings. This field has recently emerged 
as the latest advance in precision medicine because of its clinical relevance in 
diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive values. DNA methylation detected in 
ccfDNA has been widely used in personalized clinical diagnosis; furthermore, 
there is also the emerging role of ccfRNAs like miRNA and lncRNA as epigenetic 
biomarkers. This review focuses on the novel approaches for exploring ccfNAs as 
epigenetic biomarkers in personalized clinical diagnosis and prognosis, their 
potential as therapeutic targets and disease progression monitors, and reveals 
the tremendous potential that epigenetic biomarkers present to improve precision 
medicine. We explore the latest techniques for both quantitative and qualitative 
detection of epigenetic modifications in ccfNAs. The data on epigenetic 
modifications on ccfNAs are complex and often milieu-specific posing challenges 
for its understanding. Artificial intelligence and deep networks are the novel 
approaches for decoding complex data and providing insight into the 
decision-making in precision medicine.

We describe how the set of tools, practices, and social relations known as 
"precision agriculture" is defined, promoted, and debated. To do so, we perform 
a critical discourse analysis of popular and trade press websites. Promoters of 
precision agriculture champion how big data analytics, automated equipment, and 
decision-support software will optimize yields in the face of narrow margins and 
public concern about farming's environmental impacts. At its core, however, the 
idea of farmers leveraging digital infrastructure in their operations is not 
new, as agronomic research in this vein has existed for over 30 years. 
Contemporary discourse in precision ag tends to favour emerging digital 
technologies themselves over their embeddedness in longstanding precision 
management approaches. Following several strands of science and technology 
studies (STS) research, we explore what rhetorical emphasis on technical 
innovation achieves, and argue that this discourse of novelty is a reinvention 
of precision agriculture in the context of the growing "smart" agricultural 
economy. We overview six tensions that remain unresolved in this promotional 
rhetoric, concerning the definitions, history, goals, adoption, uses, and 
impacts of precision agriculture. We then synthesize these in a discussion of 
the extent to which digital tools are believed to displace farmer 
decision-making and whether digital agriculture addresses the biophysical 
heterogeneity of farm landscapes or land itself has become an "experimental 
technology"-a way to advance the general development of artificial intelligence. 
This discussion ultimately helps us name a larger dilemma: that the smart 
agricultural economy is perhaps less about supporting land and its stewards than 
promising future tech and profits.

Which signaling pathway and protein to select to mitigate the patient's expected 
drug resistance? The number of possibilities facing the physician is massive, 
and the drug combination should fit the patient status. Here, we briefly review 
current approaches and data and map an innovative patient-specific strategy to 
forecast drug resistance targets that centers on parallel (or redundant) 
proliferation pathways in specialized cells. It considers the availability of 
each protein in each pathway in the specific cell, its activating mutations, and 
the chromatin accessibility of its encoding gene. The construction of the 
resulting Proliferation Pathway Network Atlas will harness the emerging exascale 
computing and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods for therapeutic 
development. Merging the resulting set of targets, pathways, and proteins, with 
current strategies will augment the choice for the attending physicians to 
thwart resistance.

Digitalization of healthcare delivery is rapidly fostering development of 
precision medicine. Multiple digital technologies, known as telehealth or 
eHealth tools, are guiding individualized diagnosis and treatment for patients, 
and can contribute significantly to the objectives of precision medicine. From a 
basis of "one-size-fits-all" healthcare, precision medicine provides a paradigm 
shift to deliver a more nuanced and personalized approach. Genomic medicine 
utilizing new technologies can provide precision analysis of causative 
mutations, with personalized understanding of mechanisms and effective therapy. 
Education is fundamental to the telehealth process, with artificial intelligence 
(AI) enhancing learning for healthcare professionals and empowering patients to 
contribute to their care. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region is rapidly 
implementing telehealth strategies at all levels and a workshop was convened to 
discuss aspirations of precision medicine in the context of pediatric 
endocrinology, including diabetes and growth disorders, with this paper based on 
those discussions. GCC regional investment in AI, bioinformatics and genomic 
medicine, is rapidly providing healthcare benefits. However, embracing precision 
medicine is presenting some major new design, installation and skills 
challenges. Genomic medicine is enabling precision and personalization of 
diagnosis and therapy of endocrine conditions. Digital education and 
communication tools in the field of endocrinology include chatbots, interactive 
robots and augmented reality. Obesity and diabetes are a major challenge in the 
GCC region and eHealth tools are increasingly being used for management of care. 
With regard to growth failure, digital technologies for growth hormone (GH) 
administration are being shown to enhance adherence and response outcomes. While 
technical innovations become more affordable with increasing adoption, we should 
be aware of sustainability, design and implementation costs, training of HCPs 
and prediction of overall healthcare benefits, which are essential for precision 
medicine to develop and for its objectives to be achieved.

Currently, we are witnessing an increasing interest in predictive models and 
personalized diagnosis and treatment choice in psychiatric research. Against 
this background, the emerging field of Precision Psychiatry is trying to 
establish precise diagnostics and personalized therapy through Big Data. 
Electronic Health Records (EHR), smartphone-based data collection and advances 
in genotyping and imaging allow for a detailed clinical and neurobiological 
characterization of numerous patients. In order to revolutionize the treatment 
of psychiatric disorders, a personalization of psychiatry through machine 
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) is needed. We must therefore 
establish an AI ecosystem to develop and strictly validate custom-tailored AI 
and ML solutions. Furthermore, personalized predictions and detailed patient 
information must be integrated in AI-based Clinical Decision Support systems. 
Only in this way can Big Data, ML and AI support the clinician most effectively 
and help personalize treatment in psychiatry.

Publisher: Derzeit sehen wir verstärkt Ansätze in der psychiatrischen Forschung, 
die sich mit prognostischen Modellen und einer individualisierten 
Diagnosestellung und Therapieauswahl beschäftigen. Vor diesem Hintergrund strebt 
die Precision-Psychiatry, wie auch andere Teildisziplinen der Medizin, eine 
präzisere Diagnostik und individualisierte Therapie durch Big Data an. Die 
elektronische Patientenakte, Datenerfassung durch Smartphones und technische 
Fortschritte in der Genotypisierung und Bildgebung ermöglichen eine detaillierte 
klinische und neurobiologische Beschreibung einer Vielzahl von Patienten. Damit 
diese Daten tatsächlich zu einem Paradigmenwechsel in der Behandlung psychischer 
Störungen führen, braucht es eine Personalisierung der Psychiatrie durch 
Maschinelles Lernen (ML) und Künstliche Intelligenz (KI). Neben der 
Digitalisierung der Klinik müssen wir daher eine KI-Infrastruktur etablieren, in 
der maßgeschneiderte KI- und ML-Lösungen entwickelt und nach hohen 
Validierungsstandards evaluiert werden können. Zusätzlich müssen 
Modellvorhersagen und detaillierte Patienteninformationen in KI-basierte 
Clinical-Decision-Support-Systeme (CDSS) integriert werden. Nur so können Big 
Data, Maschinelles Lernen und Künstliche Intelligenz den Behandler im 
therapeutischen Alltag aktiv und effizient unterstützen und eine personalisierte 
Behandlung erreichen.

Stroke ranks among the leading causes for morbidity and mortality worldwide. New 
and continuously improving treatment options such as thrombolysis and 
thrombectomy have revolutionized acute stroke treatment in recent years. 
Following modern rhythms, the next revolution might well be the strategic use of 
the steadily increasing amounts of patient-related data for generating models 
enabling individualized outcome predictions. Milestones have already been 
achieved in several health care domains, as big data and artificial intelligence 
have entered everyday life. The aim of this review is to synoptically illustrate 
and discuss how artificial intelligence approaches may help to compute 
single-patient predictions in stroke outcome research in the acute, subacute and 
chronic stage. We will present approaches considering demographic, clinical and 
electrophysiological data, as well as data originating from various imaging 
modalities and combinations thereof. We will outline their advantages, 
disadvantages, their potential pitfalls and the promises they hold with a 
special focus on a clinical audience. Throughout the review we will highlight 
methodological aspects of novel machine-learning approaches as they are 
particularly crucial to realize precision medicine. We will finally provide an 
outlook on how artificial intelligence approaches might contribute to enhancing 
favourable outcomes after stroke.

This article provides an up-to-date review of technological advances in 3 key 
areas related to diet monitoring and precision nutrition. First, we review 
developments in mobile applications, with a focus on food photography and 
artificial intelligence to facilitate the process of diet monitoring. Second, we 
review advances in 2 types of wearable and handheld sensors that can potentially 
be used to fully automate certain aspects of diet logging: physical sensors to 
detect moments of dietary intake, and chemical sensors to estimate the 
composition of diets and meals. Finally, we review new programs that can 
generate personalized/precision nutrition recommendations based on measurements 
of gut microbiota and continuous glucose monitors with artificial intelligence. 
The article concludes with a discussion of potential pitfalls of some of these 
technologies.

To clarify the mechanisms of diseases, such as cancer, studies analyzing genetic 
mutations have been actively conducted for a long time, and a large number of 
achievements have already been reported. Indeed, genomic medicine is considered 
the core discipline of precision medicine, and currently, the clinical 
application of cutting-edge genomic medicine aimed at improving the prevention, 
diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of diseases is promoted. However, 
although the Human Genome Project was completed in 2003 and large-scale genetic 
analyses have since been accomplished worldwide with the development of 
next-generation sequencing (NGS), explaining the mechanism of disease onset only 
using genetic variation has been recognized as difficult. Meanwhile, the 
importance of epigenetics, which describes inheritance by mechanisms other than 
the genomic DNA sequence, has recently attracted attention, and, in particular, 
many studies have reported the involvement of epigenetic deregulation in human 
cancer. So far, given that genetic and epigenetic studies tend to be 
accomplished independently, physiological relationships between genetics and 
epigenetics in diseases remain almost unknown. Since this situation may be a 
disadvantage to developing precision medicine, the integrated understanding of 
genetic variation and epigenetic deregulation appears to be now critical. 
Importantly, the current progress of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, 
such as machine learning and deep learning, is remarkable and enables multimodal 
analyses of big omics data. In this regard, it is important to develop a 
platform that can conduct multimodal analysis of medical big data using AI as 
this may accelerate the realization of precision medicine. In this review, we 
discuss the importance of genome-wide epigenetic and multiomics analyses using 
AI in the era of precision medicine.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad term that combines computation with 
sophisticated mathematical models and in turn allows the development of complex 
algorithms which are capable to simulate human intelligence such as problem 
solving and learning. It is devised to promote a significant paradigm shift in 
the most diverse areas of medical knowledge. On the other hand, Cardiology is a 
vast field dealing with diseases relating to the heart, the circulatory system, 
and includes coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart 
disease and other conditions. AI has emerged as a promising tool in 
cardiovascular medicine which is aimed in augmenting the effectiveness of the 
cardiologist and to extend better quality to patients. It has the ability to 
support decision‑making and improve diagnostic and prognostic performance. 
Attempt has also been made to explore novel genotypes and phenotypes in existing 
cardiovascular diseases, improve the quality of patient care, to 
enablecost-effectiveness with reducereadmissionand mortality rates. Our review 
addresses the integration of AI and laboratory medicine as an accelerator of 
personalization care associated with the precision and the need of value 
creation services in cardiovascular medicine.

Tracking the fluctuations in blood glucose levels is important for healthy 
subjects and crucial diabetic patients. Tight glucose monitoring reduces the 
risk of hypoglycemia, which can result in a series of complications, especially 
in diabetic patients, such as confusion, irritability, seizure and can even be 
fatal in specific conditions. Hypoglycemia affects the electrophysiology of the 
heart. However, due to strong inter-subject heterogeneity, previous studies 
based on a cohort of subjects failed to deploy electrocardiogram (ECG)-based 
hypoglycemic detection systems reliably. The current study used personalised 
medicine approach and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically detect 
nocturnal hypoglycemia using a few heartbeats of raw ECG signal recorded with 
non-invasive, wearable devices, in healthy individuals, monitored 24 hours for 
14 consecutive days. Additionally, we present a visualisation method enabling 
clinicians to visualise which part of the ECG signal (e.g., T-wave, ST-interval) 
is significantly associated with the hypoglycemic event in each subject, 
overcoming the intelligibility problem of deep-learning methods. These results 
advance the feasibility of a real-time, non-invasive hypoglycemia alarming 
system using short excerpts of ECG signal.

Screening for prostate cancer relies on the serum prostate-specific antigen 
test, which provides a high rate of false positives (80%). This results in a 
large number of unnecessary biopsies and subsequent overtreatment. Considering 
the frequency of the test, there is a critical unmet need of precision screening 
for prostate cancer. Here, we introduced a urinary multimarker biosensor with a 
capacity to learn to achieve this goal. The correlation of clinical state with 
the sensing signals from urinary multimarkers was analyzed by two common machine 
learning algorithms. As the number of biomarkers was increased, both algorithms 
provided a monotonic increase in screening performance. Under the best 
combination of biomarkers, the machine learning algorithms screened prostate 
cancer patients with more than 99% accuracy using 76 urine specimens. Urinary 
multimarker biosensor leveraged by machine learning analysis can be an important 
strategy of precision screening for cancers using a drop of bodily fluid.

Combinatorial fusion algorithm (CFA) is a machine learning and artificial 
intelligence (ML/AI) framework for combining multiple scoring systems using the 
rank-score characteristic (RSC) function and cognitive diversity (CD). When 
measuring the relevance of a publication or document with respect to the 17 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, a classification 
scheme is used. However, this classification process is a challenging task due 
to the overlapping goals and contextual differences of those diverse SDGs. In 
this paper, we use CFA to combine a topic model classifier (Model A) and a 
semantic link classifier (Model B) to improve the precision of the 
classification process. We characterize and analyze each of the individual 
models using the RSC function and CD between Models A and B. We evaluate the 
classification results from combining the models using a score combination and a 
rank combination, when compared to the results obtained from human experts. In 
summary, we demonstrate that the combination of Models A and B can improve 
classification precision only if these individual models perform well and are 
diverse.

Comment in
    Pancreas. 2021 Jan 1;50(1):e11-e13.

A workshop on research gaps and opportunities for Precision Medicine in 
Pancreatic Disease was sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and 
Digestive Kidney Diseases on July 24, 2019, in Pittsburgh. The workshop included 
an overview lecture on precision medicine in cancer and 4 sessions: (1) general 
considerations for the application of bioinformatics and artificial 
intelligence; (2) omics, the combination of risk factors and biomarkers; (3) 
precision imaging; and (4) gaps, barriers, and needs to move from precision to 
personalized medicine for pancreatic disease. Current precision medicine 
approaches and tools were reviewed, and participants identified knowledge gaps 
and research needs that hinder bringing precision medicine to pancreatic 
diseases. Most critical were (a) multicenter efforts to collect large-scale 
patient data sets from multiple data streams in the context of environmental and 
social factors; (b) new information systems that can collect, annotate, and 
quantify data to inform disease mechanisms; (c) novel prospective clinical trial 
designs to test and improve therapies; and (d) a framework for measuring and 
assessing the value of proposed approaches to the health care system. With these 
advances, precision medicine can identify patients early in the course of their 
pancreatic disease and prevent progression to chronic or fatal illness.

AI Data-Driven Personalisation and Disability Inclusion.

Wald M(1).

This study aims to help people working in the field of AI understand some of the 
unique issues regarding disabled people and examines the relationship between 
the terms "Personalisation" and "Classification" with regard to disability 
inclusion. Classification using big data struggles to cope with the individual 
uniqueness of disabled people, and whereas developers tend to design for the 
majority so ignoring outliers, designing for edge cases would be a more 
inclusive approach. Other issues that are discussed in the study include 
personalising mobile technology accessibility settings with interoperable 
profiles to allow ubiquitous accessibility; the ethics of using genetic 
data-driven personalisation to ensure babies are not born with disabilities; the 
importance of including disabled people in decisions to help understand AI 
implications; the relationship between localisation and personalisation as 
assistive technologies need localising in terms of language as well as culture; 
the ways in which AI could be used to create personalised symbols for people who 
find it difficult to communicate in speech or writing; and whether blind or 
visually impaired person will be permitted to "drive" an autonomous car. This 
study concludes by suggesting that the relationship between the terms 
"Personalisation" and "Classification" with regards to AI and disability 
inclusion is a very unique one because of the heterogeneity in contrast to the 
other protected characteristics and so needs unique solutions.

This paper presents an integrated and scalable precision health service for 
health promotion and chronic disease prevention. Continuous real-time monitoring 
of lifestyle and environmental factors is implemented by integrating wearable 
devices, open environmental data, indoor air quality sensing devices, a 
location-based smartphone app, and an AI-assisted telecare platform. The 
AI-assisted telecare platform provided comprehensive insight into patients' 
clinical, lifestyle, and environmental data, and generated reliable predictions 
of future acute exacerbation events. All data from 1,667 patients were collected 
prospectively during a 24-month follow-up period, resulting in the detection of 
386 abnormal episodes. Machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms 
were used to train modular chronic disease models. The modular chronic disease 
prediction models that have passed external validation include obesity, panic 
disorder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with an average accuracy of 
88.46%, a sensitivity of 75.6%, a specificity of 93.0%, and an F1 score of 
79.8%. Compared with previous studies, we establish an effective way to collect 
lifestyle, life trajectory, and symptom records, as well as environmental 
factors, and improve the performance of the prediction model by adding objective 
comprehensive data and feature selection. Our results also demonstrate that 
lifestyle and environmental factors are highly correlated with patient health 
and have the potential to predict future abnormal events better than using only 
questionnaire data. Furthermore, we have constructed a cost-effective model that 
needs only a few features to support the prediction task, which is helpful for 
deploying real-world modular prediction models.

BACKGROUND: Automated analysis of cardiac structure and function using machine 
learning (ML) has great potential, but is currently hindered by poor 
generalizability. Comparison is traditionally against clinicians as a reference, 
ignoring inherent human inter- and intraobserver error, and ensuring that ML 
cannot demonstrate superiority. Measuring precision (scan:rescan 
reproducibility) addresses this. We compared precision of ML and humans using a 
multicenter, multi-disease, scan:rescan cardiovascular magnetic resonance data 
set.
METHODS: One hundred ten patients (5 disease categories, 5 institutions, 2 
scanner manufacturers, and 2 field strengths) underwent scan:rescan 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (96% within one week). After identification of 
the most precise human technique, left ventricular chamber volumes, mass, and 
ejection fraction were measured by an expert, a trained junior clinician, and a 
fully automated convolutional neural network trained on 599 independent 
multicenter disease cases. Scan:rescan coefficient of variation and 1000 
bootstrapped 95% CIs were calculated and compared using mixed linear effects 
models.
RESULTS: Clinicians can be confident in detecting a 9% change in left 
ventricular ejection fraction, with greater than half of coefficient of 
variation attributable to intraobserver variation. Expert, trained junior, and 
automated scan:rescan precision were similar (for left ventricular ejection 
fraction, coefficient of variation 6.1 [5.2%-7.1%], P=0.2581; 8.3 [5.6%-10.3%], 
P=0.3653; 8.8 [6.1%-11.1%], P=0.8620). Automated analysis was 186× faster than 
humans (0.07 versus 13 minutes).
CONCLUSIONS: Automated ML analysis is faster with similar precision to the most 
precise human techniques, even when challenged with real-world scan:rescan data. 
Assessment of multicenter, multi-vendor, multi-field strength scan:rescan data 
(available at www.thevolumesresource.com) permits a generalizable assessment of 
ML precision and may facilitate direct translation of ML to clinical practice.

Translational bioinformatics (TBI) is focused on the integration of biomedical 
data science and informatics. This combination is extremely powerful for 
scientific discovery as well as translation into clinical practice. Several 
topics where TBI research is at the leading edge are 1) the use of large-scale 
biobanks linked to electronic health records, 2) pharmacogenomics, and 3) 
artificial intelligence and machine learning. This perspective discusses these 
three topics and points to the important elements for driving precision medicine 
into the future.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has strong logical reasoning ability and 
independent learning ability, which can simulate the thinking process of the 
human brain. AI technologies such as machine learning can profoundly optimize 
the existing mode of anticancer drug research. But at present AI also has its 
relative limitation. In this paper, the development of artificial intelligence 
technology such as deep learning and machine learning in anticancer drug 
research is reviewed. At the same time, we look forward to the future of AI.

In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have led to 
the rapid clinical implementation of devices with AI technology in the medical 
field. More than 60 AI-equipped medical devices have already been approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, and the active 
introduction of AI technology is considered to be an inevitable trend in the 
future of medicine. In the field of oncology, clinical applications of medical 
devices using AI technology are already underway, mainly in radiology, and AI 
technology is expected to be positioned as an important core technology. In 
particular, "precision medicine," a medical treatment that selects the most 
appropriate treatment for each patient based on a vast amount of medical data 
such as genome information, has become a worldwide trend; AI technology is 
expected to be utilized in the process of extracting truly useful information 
from a large amount of medical data and applying it to diagnosis and treatment. 
In this review, we would like to introduce the history of AI technology and the 
current state of medical AI, especially in the oncology field, as well as 
discuss the possibilities and challenges of AI technology in the medical field.

PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) continues to be a global threat and 
remains a significant cause of hospitalizations. Recent clinical guidelines have 
supported the use of corticosteroids or remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19. 
However, uncertainty remains about which patients are most likely to benefit 
from treatment with either drug; such knowledge is crucial for avoiding 
preventable adverse effects, minimizing costs, and effectively allocating 
resources. This study presents a machine-learning system with the capacity to 
identify patients in whom treatment with a corticosteroid or remdesivir is 
associated with improved survival time.
METHODS: Gradient-boosted decision-tree models used for predicting treatment 
benefit were trained and tested on data from electronic health records dated 
between December 18, 2019, and October 18, 2020, from adult patients (age ≥18 
years) with COVID-19 in 10 US hospitals. Models were evaluated for performance 
in identifying patients with longer survival times when treated with a 
corticosteroid versus remdesivir. Fine and Gray proportional-hazards models were 
used for identifying significant findings in treated and nontreated patients, in 
a subset of patients who received supplemental oxygen, and in patients 
identified by the algorithm. Inverse probability-of-treatment weights were used 
to adjust for confounding. Models were trained and tested separately for each 
treatment.
FINDINGS: Data from 2364 patients were included, with men comprising slightly 
more than 50% of the sample; 893 patients were treated with remdesivir, and 1471 
were treated with a corticosteroid. After adjustment for confounding, neither 
corticosteroids nor remdesivir use was associated with increased survival time 
in the overall population or in the subpopulation that received supplemental 
oxygen. However, in the populations identified by the algorithms, both 
corticosteroids and remdesivir were significantly associated with an increase in 
survival time, with hazard ratios of 0.56 and 0.40, respectively (both, 
P = 0.04).
IMPLICATIONS: Machine-learning methods have the capacity to identify 
hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in whom treatment with a corticosteroid or 
remdesivir is associated with an increase in survival time. These methods may 
help to improve patient outcomes and allocate resources during the COVID-19 
crisis.

Precision health (PH) applied to autoimmune disease will need paradigm shifts in 
the use and application of autoantibodies and other biomarkers. For example, 
autoantibodies combined with other multi-analyte "omic" profiles will form the 
basis of disease prediction allowing for earlier intervention linked to disease 
prevention strategies, as well as earlier, effective and personalized 
interventions for established disease. As medical intervention moves to disease 
prediction and a model of "intent to PREVENT," diagnostics will include an early 
symptom/risk-based, as opposed to a disease-based approach. Newer diagnostic 
platforms that utilize emerging megatrends such as deep learning and artificial 
intelligence and close the gaps in autoantibody diagnostics will benefit from 
paradigm shifts thereby facilitating the PH agenda.

Recent rapid biotechnological breakthroughs have led to the identification of 
complex and unique molecular features that drive malignancies. Precision 
medicine has exploited next-generation sequencing and matched targeted 
therapy/immunotherapy deployment to successfully transform the outlook for 
several fatal cancers. Tumor and liquid biopsy genomic profiling and 
transcriptomic, immunomic, and proteomic interrogation can now all be leveraged 
to optimize therapy. Multiple new trial designs, including basket and umbrella 
trials, master platform trials, and N-of-1 patient-centric studies, are 
beginning to supplant standard phase I, II, and III protocols, allowing for 
accelerated drug evaluation and approval and molecular-based individualized 
treatment. Furthermore, real-world data, as well as exploitation of digital apps 
and structured observational registries, and the utilization of machine learning 
and/or artificial intelligence, may further accelerate knowledge acquisition. 
Overall, clinical trials have evolved, shifting from tumor type-centered to 
gene-directed and histology-agnostic trials, with innovative adaptive designs 
and personalized combination treatment strategies tailored to individual 
biomarker profiles. Some, but not all, novel trials now demonstrate that matched 
therapy correlates with superior outcomes compared to non-matched therapy across 
tumor types and in specific cancers. To further improve the precision medicine 
paradigm, the strategy of matching drugs to patients based on molecular features 
should be implemented earlier in the disease course, and cancers should have 
comprehensive multi-omic (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomic) 
tumor profiling. To overcome cancer complexity, moving from drug-centric to 
patient-centric individualized combination therapy is critical. This review 
focuses on the design, advantages, limitations, and challenges of a spectrum of 
clinical trial designs in the era of precision oncology.

OBJECTIVE: Phenotypic heterogeneity among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is ill defined. We 
used cluster analysis machine-learning algorithms to identify phenotypes among 
trial participants with T2DM and ASCVD.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the Trial Evaluating 
Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS) study (n = 14,671), a 
cardiovascular outcome safety trial comparing sitagliptin with placebo in 
patients with T2DM and ASCVD (median follow-up 3.0 years). Cluster analysis 
using 40 baseline variables was conducted, with associations between clusters 
and the primary composite outcome (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina) assessed by 
Cox proportional hazards models. We replicated the results using the Exenatide 
Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) trial.
RESULTS: Four distinct phenotypes were identified: cluster I included Caucasian 
men with a high prevalence of coronary artery disease; cluster II included Asian 
patients with a low BMI; cluster III included women with noncoronary ASCVD 
disease; and cluster IV included patients with heart failure and kidney 
dysfunction. The primary outcome occurred, respectively, in 11.6%, 8.6%, 10.3%, 
and 16.8% of patients in clusters I to IV. The crude difference in 
cardiovascular risk for the highest versus lowest risk cluster (cluster IV vs. 
II) was statistically significant (hazard ratio 2.74 [95% CI 2.29-3.29]). 
Similar phenotypes and outcomes were identified in EXSCEL.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM and ASCVD, cluster analysis identified four 
clinically distinct groups. Further cardiovascular phenotyping is warranted to 
inform patient care and optimize clinical trial designs.

Artificial Intelligence is providing astonishing results, with medicine being 
one of its favourite playgrounds. Machine Learning and, in particular, Deep 
Neural Networks are behind this revolution. Among the most challenging targets 
of interest in medicine are cancer diagnosis and therapies but, to start this 
revolution, software tools need to be adapted to cover the new requirements. In 
this sense, learning tools are becoming a commodity but, to be able to assist 
doctors on a daily basis, it is essential to fully understand how models can be 
interpreted. In this survey, we analyse current machine learning models and 
other in-silico tools as applied to medicine-specifically, to cancer 
research-and we discuss their interpretability, performance and the input data 
they are fed with. Artificial neural networks (ANN), logistic regression (LR) 
and support vector machines (SVM) have been observed to be the preferred models. 
In addition, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), supported by the rapid 
development of graphic processing units (GPUs) and high-performance computing 
(HPC) infrastructures, are gaining importance when image processing is feasible. 
However, the interpretability of machine learning predictions so that doctors 
can understand them, trust them and gain useful insights for the clinical 
practice is still rarely considered, which is a factor that needs to be improved 
to enhance doctors' predictive capacity and achieve individualised therapies in 
the near future.

In the past decade, the emergence of machine learning (ML) applications has led 
to significant advances towards implementation of personalised medicine 
approaches for improved health care, due to the exceptional performance of ML 
models when utilising complex big data. The immune-mediated chronic inflammatory 
diseases are a group of complex disorders associated with dysregulated immune 
responses resulting in inflammation affecting various organs and systems. The 
heterogeneous nature of these diseases poses great challenges for tailored 
disease management and addressing unmet patient needs. Applying novel ML 
techniques to the clinical study of chronic inflammatory diseases shows 
promising results and great potential for precision medicine applications in 
clinical research and practice. In this review, we highlight the clinical 
applications of various ML techniques for prediction, diagnosis and prognosis of 
autoimmune rheumatic diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune chronic 
kidney disease, and multiple sclerosis, as well as ML applications for patient 
stratification and treatment selection. We highlight the use of ML in drug 
development, including target identification, validation and drug repurposing, 
as well as challenges related to data interpretation and validation, and ethical 
concerns related to the use of artificial intelligence in clinical research.

BACKGROUND: Patients' choices of providers when undergoing elective surgeries 
significantly impact both perioperative outcomes and costs. There exist a 
variety of approaches that are available to patients for evaluating between 
different hospital choices.
OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to compare differences in outcomes and costs between 
hospitals ranked using popular internet-based consumer ratings, quality stars, 
reputation rankings, average volumes, average outcomes, and precision machine 
learning-based rankings for hospital settings performing hip replacements in a 
large metropolitan area.
METHODS: Retrospective data from 4192 hip replacement surgeries among Medicare 
beneficiaries in 2018 in a the Chicago metropolitan area were analyzed for 
variations in outcomes (90-day postprocedure hospitalizations and emergency 
department visits) and costs (90-day total cost of care) between hospitals 
ranked through multiple approaches: internet-based consumer ratings, quality 
stars, reputation rankings, average yearly surgical volume, average outcome 
rates, and machine learning-based rankings. The average rates of outcomes and 
costs were compared between the patients who underwent surgery at a hospital 
using each ranking approach in unadjusted and propensity-based adjusted 
comparisons.
RESULTS: Only a minority of patients (1159/4192, 27.6% to 2078/4192, 49.6%) were 
found to be matched to higher-ranked hospitals for each of the different 
approaches. Of the approaches considered, hip replacements at hospitals that 
were more highly ranked by consumer ratings, quality stars, and machine learning 
were all consistently associated with improvements in outcomes and costs in both 
adjusted and unadjusted analyses. The improvement was greatest across all 
metrics and analyses for machine learning-based rankings.
CONCLUSIONS: There may be a substantive opportunity to increase the number of 
patients matched to appropriate hospitals across a broad variety of ranking 
approaches. Elective hip replacement surgeries performed at hospitals where 
patients were matched based on patient-specific machine learning were associated 
with better outcomes and lower total costs of care.

Atom segmentation and localization, noise reduction and deblurring of 
atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images with 
high precision and robustness is a challenging task. Although several 
conventional algorithms, such has thresholding, edge detection and clustering, 
can achieve reasonable performance in some predefined sceneries, they tend to 
fail when interferences from the background are strong and unpredictable. 
Particularly, for atomic-resolution STEM images, so far there is no 
well-established algorithm that is robust enough to segment or detect all atomic 
columns when there is large thickness variation in a recorded image. Herein, we 
report the development of a training library and a deep learning method that can 
perform robust and precise atom segmentation, localization, denoising, and 
super-resolution processing of experimental images. Despite using simulated 
images as training datasets, the deep-learning model can self-adapt to 
experimental STEM images and shows outstanding performance in atom detection and 
localization in challenging contrast conditions and the precision consistently 
outperforms the state-of-the-art two-dimensional Gaussian fit method. Taking a 
step further, we have deployed our deep-learning models to a desktop app with a 
graphical user interface and the app is free and open-source. We have also built 
a TEM ImageNet project website for easy browsing and downloading of the training 
data.

Pharmacoepidemiology is the study of the safety and effectiveness of medications 
following market approval. The increased availability and size of healthcare 
utilization databases allows for the study of rare adverse events, sub-group 
analyses, and long-term follow-up. These datasets are large, including thousands 
of patient records spanning multiple years of observation, and representative of 
real-world clinical practice. Thus, one of the main advantages is the 
possibility to study the real-world safety and effectiveness of medications in 
uncontrolled environments. Due to the large size (volume), structure (variety), 
and availability (velocity) of observational healthcare databases there is a 
large interest in the application of natural language processing and machine 
learning, including the development of novel models to detect drug-drug 
interactions, patient phenotypes, and outcome prediction. This report will 
provide an overview of the current challenges in pharmacoepidemiology and where 
machine learning applications may be useful for filling the gap.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disabling disease, characterized by chronic 
inflammation of the colon, with a rising prevalence worldwide in the pediatric 
age group. Although UC presents in children with varying severity, disease 
extent, and comorbidities, initial treatment is essentially uniform, consisting 
of 5-aminosalicylate drugs with corticosteroid induction for those with 
moderately to severely active disease. With the advent of anti-tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF) biologic therapy and several new biologics and small-molecule drugs 
for UC, precision medicine approaches to treatment are needed to more rapidly 
achieve sustained remission, restore quality of life, normalize development, and 
limit exposure to toxic corticosteroids in children with UC. Here, we review 
available data on clinical, biochemical, histopathologic, and molecular 
predictors of treatment response in UC. We also address known predictors and 
special treatment considerations in specific relevant scenarios such as 
very-early-onset UC, acute severe UC, ileal pouch anal anastomosis, and UC with 
concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis. The review concludes with a 
prediction of how machine learning will integrate multimodal patient data to 
bring precision medicine to the bedside of children with UC in the future.

Full-quantum mechanics (QM) calculations are extraordinarily precise but 
difficult to apply to large systems, such as biomolecules. Motivated by the 
massive demand for efficient calculations for large systems at the full-QM level 
and by the significant advances in machine learning, we have designed a neural 
network-based two-body molecular fractionation with conjugate caps (NN-TMFCC) 
approach to accelerate the energy and atomic force calculations of proteins. The 
results show very high precision for the proposed NN potential energy surface 
models of residue-based fragments, with energy root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) 
less than 1.0 kcal/mol and force RMSEs less than 1.3 kcal/mol/Å for both 
training and testing sets. The proposed NN-TMFCC method calculates the energies 
and atomic forces of 15 representative proteins with full-QM precision in 
10-100 s, which is thousands of times faster than the full-QM calculations. The 
computational complexity of the NN-TMFCC method is independent of the protein 
size and only depends on the number of residue species, which makes this method 
particularly suitable for rapid prediction of large systems with tens of 
thousands or even hundreds of thousands of times acceleration. This highly 
precise and efficient NN-TMFCC approach exhibits considerable potential for 
performing energy and force calculations, structure predictions and molecular 
dynamics simulations of proteins with full-QM precision.

Reducing risk from pesticide applications has been gaining serious attention in 
the last few decades due to the significant damage to human health, environment, 
and ecosystems. Pesticide applications are an essential part of current 
agriculture, enhancing cultivated crop productivity and quality and preventing 
losses of up to 45% of the world food supply. However, inappropriate and 
excessive use of pesticides is a major rising concern. Precision spraying 
addresses these concerns by precisely and efficiently applying pesticides to the 
target area and substantially reducing pesticide usage while maintaining 
efficacy at preventing crop losses. This review provides a systematic summary of 
current technologies used for precision spraying in tree fruits and highlights 
their potential, briefly discusses factors affecting spraying parameters, and 
concludes with possible solutions to reduce excessive agrochemical uses. We 
conclude there is a critical need for appropriate sensing techniques that can 
accurately detect the target. In addition, air jet velocity, travel speed, wind 
speed and direction, droplet size, and canopy characteristics need to be 
considered for successful droplet deposition by the spraying system. Assessment 
of terrain is important when field elevation has significant variability. 
Control of airflow during spraying is another important parameter that needs to 
be considered. Incorporation of these variables in precision spraying systems 
will optimize spray decisions and help reduce excessive agrochemical 
applications.

Machine learning is an important artificial intelligence technique that is 
widely applied in cancer diagnosis and detection. More recently, with the rise 
of personalised and precision medicine, there is a growing trend towards machine 
learning applications for prognosis prediction. However, to date, building 
reliable prediction models of cancer outcomes in everyday clinical practice is 
still a hurdle. In this work, we integrate genomic, clinical and demographic 
data of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients 
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and introduce copy number variation (CNV) 
and mutation information of 15 selected genes to generate predictive models for 
recurrence and survivability. We compare the accuracy and benefits of three 
well-established machine learning algorithms: decision tree methods, neural 
networks and support vector machines. Although the accuracy of predictive models 
using the decision tree method has no significant advantage, the tree models 
reveal the most important predictors among genomic information (e.g. KRAS, EGFR, 
TP53), clinical status (e.g. TNM stage and radiotherapy) and demographics (e.g. 
age and gender) and how they influence the prediction of recurrence and 
survivability for both early stage LUAD and LUSC. The machine learning models 
have the potential to help clinicians to make personalised decisions on aspects 
such as follow-up timeline and to assist with personalised planning of future 
social care needs.

Increasingly large deep learning architectures, such as Deep Belief Networks 
(DBNs) are the focus of current machine learning research and achieve 
state-of-the-art results in different domains. However, both training and 
execution of large-scale Deep Networks require vast computing resources, leading 
to high power requirements and communication overheads. The on-going work on 
design and construction of spike-based hardware platforms offers an alternative 
for running deep neural networks with significantly lower power consumption, but 
has to overcome hardware limitations in terms of noise and limited weight 
precision, as well as noise inherent in the sensor signal. This article 
investigates how such hardware constraints impact the performance of spiking 
neural network implementations of DBNs. In particular, the influence of limited 
bit precision during execution and training, and the impact of silicon mismatch 
in the synaptic weight parameters of custom hybrid VLSI implementations is 
studied. Furthermore, the network performance of spiking DBNs is characterized 
with regard to noise in the spiking input signal. Our results demonstrate that 
spiking DBNs can tolerate very low levels of hardware bit precision down to 
almost two bits, and show that their performance can be improved by at least 30% 
through an adapted training mechanism that takes the bit precision of the target 
platform into account. Spiking DBNs thus present an important use-case for 
large-scale hybrid analog-digital or digital neuromorphic platforms such as 
SpiNNaker, which can execute large but precision-constrained deep networks in 
real time.

Precision health economics and outcomes research (P-HEOR) integrates economic 
and clinical value assessment by explicitly discovering distinct clinical and 
health care utilization phenotypes among patients. Through a conceptualized 
example, the objective of this review is to highlight the capabilities and 
limitations of machine learning (ML) applications to P-HEOR and to contextualize 
the potential opportunities and challenges for the wide adoption of ML for 
health economics. We outline a P-HEOR conceptual framework extending the ML 
methodology to comparatively assess the economic value of treatment regimens. 
Latest methodology developments on bias and confounding control in ML 
applications to precision medicine are also summarized.

Privacy-Preserving Artificial Intelligence: Application to Precision Medicine.

Vizitiu A, Nita CI, Puiu A, Suciu C, Itu LM.

Motivated by state-of-the-art performances across a wide variety of areas, over 
the last few years Machine Learning has drawn a significant amount of attention 
from the healthcare domain. Despite their potential in enabling person-alized 
medicine applications, the adoption of Deep Learning based solutions in clinical 
workflows has been hindered in many cases by the strict regulations concerning 
the privacy of patient health data. We propose a solution that relies on Fully 
Homomorphic Encryption, particularly on the MORE scheme, as a mechanism for 
enabling computations on sensitive health data, without revealing the underlying 
data. The chosen variant of the encryption scheme allows for the computations in 
the Neural Network model to be directly performed on floating point numbers, 
while incurring a reasonably small computational overhead. For feasibility 
evaluation, we demonstrate on the MNIST digit recognition task that Deep 
Learning can be performed on encrypted data without compromising the accuracy. 
We then address a more complex task by training a model on encrypted data to 
estimate the outputs of a whole-body circulation (WBC) model. These results 
underline the potential of the proposed approach to outperform current solutions 
by delivering comparable results to the unencrypted Deep Learning based 
solutions, in a reasonable amount of time. Lastly, the security aspects of the 
encryption scheme are analyzed, and we show that, even though the chosen 
encryption scheme favors performance and utility at the cost of weaker security, 
it can still be used in certain practical applications.

BACKGROUND: To construct and validate a deep learning cluster from whole slide 
images (WSI) for depicting the immunophenotypes and functional heterogeneity of 
the tumor microenvironment (TME) in patients with bladder cancer (BLCA) and to 
explore an artificial intelligence (AI) score to explore the underlying 
biological pathways in the developed WSI cluster.
METHODS: In this study, the WSI cluster was constructed based on a deep learning 
procedure. Further rerecognition of TME features in pathological images was 
applied based on a neural network. Then, we integrated the TCGA cohort and 
several external testing cohorts to explore and validate this novel WSI cluster 
and a corresponding quantitative indicator, the AI score. Finally, correlations 
between the AI cluster (AI score) and classical BLCA molecular subtypes, 
immunophenotypes, functional heterogeneity, and potential therapeutic method in 
BLCA were assessed.
RESULTS: The WSI cluster was identified associated with clinical survival (P < 
0.001) and was proved as an independent predictor (P = 0.031), which could also 
predict the immunology and the clinical significance of BLCA. Rerecognition of 
pathological images established a robust 3-year survival prediction model (with 
an average classification accuracy of 86%, AUC of 0.95) for BLCA patients 
combining TME features and clinical features. In addition, an AI score was 
constructed to quantify the underlying logic of the WSI cluster (AUC = 0.838). 
Finally, we hypothesized that high AI score shapes an immune-hot TME in BLCA. 
Thus, treatment options including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), 
chemotherapy, and ERBB therapy can be used for the treatment of BLCA patients in 
WSI cluster1 (high AI score subtype).
CONCLUSIONS: In general, we showed that deep learning can predict prognosis and 
may aid in the precision medicine for BLCA directly from H&E histology, which is 
more economical and efficient.

OBJECTIVE: The fields of medicine and public health are undergoing a data 
revolution. An increasing availability of data has brought about a growing 
interest in machine-learning algorithms. Our objective is to present the reader 
with an introduction to a knowledge representation and machine-learning tool for 
risk estimation in medical science known as Bayesian networks (BNs).
STUDY DESIGN: In this article we review how BNs are compact and intuitive 
graphical representations of joint probability distributions (JPDs) that can be 
used to conduct causal reasoning and risk estimation analysis and offer several 
advantages over regression-based methods. We discuss how BNs represent a 
different approach to risk estimation in that they are graphical representations 
of JPDs that take the form of a network representing model random variables and 
the influences between them, respectively.
METHODS: We explore some of the challenges associated with traditional risk 
prediction methods and then describe BNs, their construction, application, and 
advantages in risk prediction based on examples in cancer and heart disease.
RESULTS: Risk modeling with BNs has advantages over regression-based approaches, 
and in this article we focus on three that are relevant to health outcomes 
research: (1) the generation of network structures in which relationships 
between variables can be easily communicated; (2) their ability to apply Bayes's 
theorem to conduct individual-level risk estimation; and (3) their easy 
transformation into decision models.
CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian networks represent a powerful and flexible tool for the 
analysis of health economics and outcomes research data in the era of precision 
medicine.

PURPOSE: In the multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) method, a large enough atlas set, 
which can cover the complete spectrum of the whole population pattern of the 
target object will benefit the segmentation quality. However, the difficulty in 
obtaining and generating such a large set of atlases and the computational 
burden required in the segmentation procedure make this approach impractical. In 
this paper, we propose a method called SOMA to select subject-, object-, and 
modality-adapted precision atlases for automatic anatomy recognition in medical 
images with pathology, following the idea that different regions of the target 
object in a novel image can be recognized by different atlases with regionally 
best similarity, so that effective atlases have no need to be globally similar 
to the target subject and also have no need to be overall similar to the target 
object.
METHODS: The SOMA method consists of three main components: atlas building, 
object recognition, and object delineation. Considering the computational 
complexity, we utilize an all-to-template strategy to align all images to the 
same image space belonging to the root image determined by the minimum spanning 
tree (MST) strategy among a subset of radiologically near-normal images. The 
object recognition process is composed of two stages: rough recognition and 
refined recognition. In rough recognition, subimage matching is conducted 
between the test image and each image of the whole atlas set, and only the atlas 
corresponding to the best-matched subimage contributes to the recognition map 
regionally. The frequency of best match for each atlas is recorded by a counter, 
and the atlases with the highest frequencies are selected as the precision 
atlases. In refined recognition, only the precision atlases are examined, and 
the subimage matching is conducted in a nonlocal manner of searching to further 
increase the accuracy of boundary matching. Delineation is based on a 
U-net-based deep learning network, where the original gray scale image together 
with the fuzzy map from refined recognition compose a two-channel input to the 
network, and the output is a segmentation map of the target object.
RESULTS: Experiments are conducted on computed tomography (CT) images with 
different qualities in two body regions - head and neck (H&N) and thorax, from 
298 subjects with nine objects and 241 subjects with six objects, respectively. 
Most objects achieve a localization error within two voxels after refined 
recognition, with marked improvement in localization accuracy from rough to 
refined recognition of 0.6-3 mm in H&N and 0.8-4.9 mm in thorax, and also in 
delineation accuracy (Dice coefficient) from refined recognition to delineation 
of 0.01-0.11 in H&N and 0.01-0.18 in thorax.
CONCLUSIONS: The SOMA method shows high accuracy and robustness in anatomy 
recognition and delineation. The improvements from rough to refined recognition 
and further to delineation, as well as immunity of recognition accuracy to 
varying image and object qualities, demonstrate the core principles of SOMA 
where segmentation accuracy increases with precision atlases and gradually 
refined object matching.

Causal machine learning (CML) has experienced increasing popularity in 
healthcare. Beyond the inherent capabilities of adding domain knowledge into 
learning systems, CML provides a complete toolset for investigating how a system 
would react to an intervention (e.g. outcome given a treatment). Quantifying 
effects of interventions allows actionable decisions to be made while 
maintaining robustness in the presence of confounders. Here, we explore how 
causal inference can be incorporated into different aspects of clinical decision 
support systems by using recent advances in machine learning. Throughout this 
paper, we use Alzheimer's disease to create examples for illustrating how CML 
can be advantageous in clinical scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss important 
challenges present in healthcare applications such as processing 
high-dimensional and unstructured data, generalization to out-of-distribution 
samples and temporal relationships, that despite the great effort from the 
research community remain to be solved. Finally, we review lines of research 
within causal representation learning, causal discovery and causal reasoning 
which offer the potential towards addressing the aforementioned challenges.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by heterogeneity in 
susceptibility to the disease and severity of illness. Understanding 
inter-individual variation has important implications for not only allocation of 
resources but also targeting patients for escalation of care, inclusion in 
clinical trials, and individualized medical therapy including vaccination. In 
addition to geographic location and social vulnerability, there are clear 
biological differences such as age, sex, race, presence of comorbidities, 
underlying genetic variation, and differential immune response that contribute 
to variability in disease manifestation. These differences may have implications 
for precision medicine. Specific examples include the observation that androgens 
regulate the expression of the enzyme transmembrane protease, serine 2 which 
facilitates severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral entry into the 
cell; therefore, androgen deprivation therapy is being explored as a treatment 
option in males infected with COVID-19. An immunophenotyping study of COVID-19 
patients has shown that a subset develop T cytopenia which has prompted a 
clinical trial that is testing the efficacy of interleukin-7 in these patients. 
Predicting which COVID-19 patients will develop progressive disease that will 
require hospitalization has important implications for clinical trials that 
target outpatients. Enrollment of patients at low risk for progression of 
disease and hospitalization would likely not result in such therapy 
demonstrating efficacy. There are efforts to use artificial intelligence to 
integrate digital data from smartwatch applications or digital monitoring 
systems and biological data to enable identification of the high risk COVID-19 
patient. The ultimate goal of precision medicine using such modern technology is 
to recognize individual differences to improve health for all.

Potential Celiac Patients (PCD) bear the Celiac Disease (CD) genetic 
predisposition, a significant production of antihuman transglutaminase 
antibodies, but no morphological changes in the small bowel mucosa. A minority 
of patients (17%) showed clinical symptoms and need a gluten free diet at time 
of diagnosis, while the majority progress over several years (up to a decade) 
without any clinical problem neither a progression of the small intestine 
mucosal damage even when they continued to assume gluten in their diet. Recently 
we developed a traditional multivariate approach to predict the natural history, 
on the base of the information at enrolment (time 0) by a discriminant analysis 
model. Still, the traditional multivariate model requires stringent assumptions 
that may not be answered in the clinical setting. Starting from a follow-up 
dataset available for PCD, we propose the application of Machine Learning (ML) 
methodologies to extend the analysis on available clinical data and to detect 
most influent features predicting the outcome. These features, collected at time 
of diagnosis, should be capable to classify patients who will develop duodenal 
atrophy from those who will remain potential. Four ML methods were adopted to 
select features predictive of the outcome; the feature selection procedure was 
indeed capable to reduce the number of overall features from 85 to 19. ML 
methodologies (Random Forests, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Boosted Trees, 
Logistic Regression) were adopted, obtaining high values of accuracy: all report 
an accuracy above 75%. The specificity score was always more than 75% also, with 
two of the considered methods over 98%, while the best performance of 
sensitivity was 60%. The best model, optimized Boosted Trees, was able to 
classify PCD starting from the selected 19 features with an accuracy of 0.80, 
sensitivity of 0.58 and specificity of 0.84. Finally, with this work, we are 
able to categorize PCD patients that can more likely develop overt CD using ML. 
ML techniques appear to be an innovative approach to predict the outcome of PCD, 
since they provide a step forward in the direction of precision medicine aimed 
to customize healthcare, medical therapies, decisions, and practices tailoring 
the clinical management of PCD children.

The ever-increasing amount of biomedical data is enabling new large-scale 
studies, even though ad hoc computational solutions are required. The most 
recent Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have 
been achieving outstanding performance and an important impact in clinical 
research, aiming at precision medicine, as well as improving healthcare 
workflows. However, the inherent heterogeneity and uncertainty in the healthcare 
information sources pose new compelling challenges for clinicians in their 
decision-making tasks. Only the proper combination of AI and human intelligence 
capabilities, by explicitly taking into account effective and safe interaction 
paradigms, can permit the delivery of care that outperforms what either can do 
separately. Therefore, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) plays a crucial role in 
the design of software oriented to decision-making in medicine. In this work, we 
systematically review and discuss several research fields strictly linked to HCI 
and clinical decision-making, by subdividing the articles into six themes, 
namely: Interfaces, Visualization, Electronic Health Records, Devices, 
Usability, and Clinical Decision Support Systems. However, these articles 
typically present overlaps among the themes, revealing that HCI inter-connects 
multiple topics. With the goal of focusing on HCI and design aspects, the 
articles under consideration were grouped into four clusters. The advances in AI 
can effectively support the physicians' cognitive processes, which certainly 
play a central role in decision-making tasks because the human mental behavior 
cannot be completely emulated and captured; the human mind might solve a complex 
problem even without a statistically significant amount of data by relying upon 
domain knowledge. For this reason, technology must focus on interactive 
solutions for supporting the physicians effectively in their daily activities, 
by exploiting their unique knowledge and evidence-based reasoning, as well as 
improving the various aspects highlighted in this review.

Aerial imagery is regularly used by crop researchers, growers and farmers to 
monitor crops during the growing season. To extract meaningful information from 
large-scale aerial images collected from the field, high-throughput phenotypic 
analysis solutions are required, which not only produce high-quality measures of 
key crop traits, but also support professionals to make prompt and reliable crop 
management decisions. Here, we report AirSurf, an automated and open-source 
analytic platform that combines modern computer vision, up-to-date machine 
learning, and modular software engineering in order to measure yield-related 
phenotypes from ultra-large aerial imagery. To quantify millions of in-field 
lettuces acquired by fixed-wing light aircrafts equipped with normalised 
difference vegetation index (NDVI) sensors, we customised AirSurf by combining 
computer vision algorithms and a deep-learning classifier trained with over 
100,000 labelled lettuce signals. The tailored platform, AirSurf-Lettuce, is 
capable of scoring and categorising iceberg lettuces with high accuracy (>98%). 
Furthermore, novel analysis functions have been developed to map lettuce size 
distribution across the field, based on which associated global positioning 
system (GPS) tagged harvest regions have been identified to enable growers and 
farmers to conduct precision agricultural practises in order to improve the 
actual yield as well as crop marketability before the harvest.

INTRODUCTION: To facilitate the initial clinical decision regarding whether to 
use esophagectomy alone or neoadjuvant therapy in surgical care for individual 
patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric 
junction-information not available from randomized trials-a machine-learning 
analysis was performed using worldwide real-world data on patients undergoing 
different therapies for this rare adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: Using random forest technology in a sequential analysis, we (1) 
identified eligibility for each of four therapies among 13,365 patients: 
esophagectomy alone (n = 6649), neoadjuvant therapy (n = 4706), esophagectomy 
and adjuvant therapy (n = 998), and neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy (n = 1022); 
(2) performed survival analyses incorporating interactions of patient and cancer 
characteristics with therapy; (3) determined optimal therapy as that predicted 
to maximize lifetime within 10 years (restricted mean survival time; RMST) for 
each patient; and (4) compared lifetime gained from optimal versus actual 
therapies.
RESULTS: Actual therapy was optimal in 61% of those receiving esophagectomy 
alone; neoadjuvant therapy was optimal for 36% receiving neoadjuvant therapy. 
Many patients were predicted to benefit from postoperative adjuvant therapy. 
Total RMST for actual therapy received was 58,825 years. Had patients received 
optimal therapy, total RMST was predicted to be 62,982 years, a 7% gain.
CONCLUSIONS: Average treatment effect for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus yields 
only crude evidence-based therapy guidelines. However, patient response to 
therapy is widely variable, and survival after data-driven predicted optimal 
therapy often differs from actual therapy received. Therapy must address an 
individual patient's cancer and clinical characteristics to provide precision 
surgical therapy for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric 
junction.

Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), in the form of structural, catalytic or regulatory 
RNAs, have emerged to be critical effectors of many biological processes. With 
the advent of new technologies, we have begun to appreciate how intracellular 
and circulatory ncRNAs elegantly choreograph the regulation of gene expression 
and protein function(s) in the cell. Armed with this knowledge, the clinical 
utility of ncRNAs as biomarkers has been recently tested in a wide range of 
human diseases. In this review, we examine how critical factors govern the 
success of interrogating ncRNA biomarker expression in liquid biopsies and 
tissues to enhance our current clinical management of human diseases, 
particularly in the context of cancer. We also discuss strategies to overcome 
key challenges that preclude ncRNAs from becoming standard-of-care clinical 
biomarkers, including sample pre-analytics standardization, data 
cross-validation with closer attention to discordant findings, as well as 
correlation with clinical outcomes. Although harnessing multi-modal information 
from disease-associated noncoding RNome (ncRNome) in biofluids or in tissues 
using artificial intelligence or machine learning is at the nascent stage, it 
will undoubtedly fuel the community adoption of precision population health.

This paper proposes an encoder-decoder architecture for kidney segmentation. A 
hyperparameter optimization process is implemented, including the development of 
a model architecture, selecting a windowing method and a loss function, and data 
augmentation. The model consists of EfficientNet-B5 as the encoder and a feature 
pyramid network as the decoder that yields the best performance with a Dice 
score of 0.969 on the 2019 Kidney and Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge 
dataset. The proposed model is tested with different voxel spacing, anatomical 
planes, and kidney and tumor volumes. Moreover, case studies are conducted to 
analyze segmentation outliers. Finally, five-fold cross-validation and the 
3D-IRCAD-01 dataset are used to evaluate the developed model in terms of the 
following evaluation metrics: the Dice score, recall, precision, and the 
Intersection over Union score. A new development and application of artificial 
intelligence algorithms to solve image analysis and interpretation will be 
demonstrated in this paper. Overall, our experiment results show that the 
proposed kidney segmentation solutions in CT images can be significantly applied 
to clinical needs to assist surgeons in surgical planning. It enables the 
calculation of the total kidney volume for kidney function estimation in ADPKD 
and supports radiologists or doctors in disease diagnoses and disease 
progression.

The rapid development of digital health devices has enabled patients to engage 
in their care to an unprecedented degree and holds the possibility of 
significantly improving the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of many medical 
conditions. Combined with the emergence of artificial intelligence algorithms, 
biometric datasets produced from these digital health devices present new 
opportunities to create precision-based, personalized approaches for healthcare 
delivery. For effective implementation of such innovations to patient care, 
clinicians will require an understanding of the types of datasets produced from 
digital health technologies; the types of analytic methods including feature 
selection, convolution neural networking, and deep learning that can be used to 
analyze digital data; and how the interpretation of these findings are best 
translated to patient care. In this perspective, we aim to provide the 
groundwork for clinicians to be able to apply artificial intelligence to this 
transformation of healthcare.

Precision agriculture is considered to be a fundamental approach in pursuing a 
low-input, high-efficiency, and sustainable kind of agriculture when performing 
site-specific management practices. To achieve this objective, a reliable and 
updated description of the local status of crops is required. Remote sensing, 
and in particular satellite-based imagery, proved to be a valuable tool in crop 
mapping, monitoring, and diseases assessment. However, freely available 
satellite imagery with low or moderate resolutions showed some limits in 
specific agricultural applications, e.g., where crops are grown by rows. Indeed, 
in this framework, the satellite's output could be biased by intra-row covering, 
giving inaccurate information about crop status. This paper presents a novel 
satellite imagery refinement framework, based on a deep learning technique which 
exploits information properly derived from high resolution images acquired by 
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne multispectral sensors. To train the 
convolutional neural network, only a single UAV-driven dataset is required, 
making the proposed approach simple and cost-effective. A vineyard in Serralunga 
d'Alba (Northern Italy) was chosen as a case study for validation purposes. 
Refined satellite-driven normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps, 
acquired in four different periods during the vine growing season, were shown to 
better describe crop status with respect to raw datasets by correlation analysis 
and ANOVA. In addition, using a K-means based classifier, 3-class vineyard vigor 
maps were profitably derived from the NDVI maps, which are a valuable tool for 
growers.

Health is often qualitatively defined as a status free from disease and its 
quantitative definition requires finding the boundary separating health from 
pathological conditions. Since many complex diseases have a strong genetic 
component, substantial efforts have been made to sequence large-scale personal 
genomes; however, we are not yet able to effectively quantify health status from 
personal genomes. Since mutational impacts are ultimately manifested at the 
protein level, we envision that introducing a panoramic proteomic view of 
complex diseases will allow us to mechanistically understand the molecular 
etiologies of human diseases. In this perspective article, we will highlight key 
proteomic approaches to identify pathogenic mutations and map their convergent 
pathways underlying disease pathogenesis and the integration of omics data at 
multiple levels to define the borderline between health and disease.

Precision medicine approaches rely on obtaining precise knowledge of the true 
state of health of an individual patient, which results from a combination of 
their genetic risks and environmental exposures. This approach is currently 
limited by the lack of effective and efficient non-invasive medical tests to 
define the full range of phenotypic variation associated with individual health. 
Such knowledge is critical for improved early intervention, for better treatment 
decisions, and for ameliorating the steadily worsening epidemic of chronic 
disease. We present proof-of-concept experiments to demonstrate how routinely 
acquired cross-sectional CT imaging may be used to predict patient longevity as 
a proxy for overall individual health and disease status using computer image 
analysis techniques. Despite the limitations of a modest dataset and the use of 
off-the-shelf machine learning methods, our results are comparable to previous 
'manual' clinical methods for longevity prediction. This work demonstrates that 
radiomics techniques can be used to extract biomarkers relevant to one of the 
most widely used outcomes in epidemiological and clinical research - mortality, 
and that deep learning with convolutional neural networks can be usefully 
applied to radiomics research. Computer image analysis applied to routinely 
collected medical images offers substantial potential to enhance precision 
medicine initiatives.

Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) have received considerable attention as a 
potential biomarker source for the diagnosis of urinary diseases. Present 
studies mainly focus on the discovery of biomarkers based on high-throughput 
proteomics, while limited efforts have been paid to applying the uEVs' 
biomarkers for the diagnosis of early urinary disease. Herein, we demonstrate a 
diagnosis protocol to realize ultrasensitive detection of uEVs and accurate 
classification of early urinary diseases, by combing a ratiometric 
three-dimensional (3D) DNA machine with machine learning (ML). The ratiometric 
3D DNA machine platform is constructed by conjugating a padlock probe (PLP) 
containing cytosine-rich (C-rich) sequences, anchor strands, and 
nucleic-acid-stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNAAgNCs) onto the magnetic 
nanoparticles (MNPs). The competitive binding of uEVs with the aptamer releases 
the walker strand, thus the ratiometric 3D DNA machine was activated to undergo 
an accurate amplification reaction and produce a ratiometric fluorescence 
signal. The present biosensor offers a detection limit of 9.9 × 103 particles 
mL-1 with a linear range of 104-108 particles mL-1 for uEVs. Two ML algorithms, 
K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM), were subsequently 
applied for analyzing the correlation between the sensing signals of uEV 
multibiomarkers and the clinical state. The disease diagnostic accuracy of 
optimal biomarker combination reaches 95% and 100% by analyzing with KNN and 
SVM, and the disease type classification exhibits an accuracy of 94.7% and 
89.5%, respectively. Moreover, the protocol results in 100% accurate visual 
identification of clinical uEV samples from individuals with disease or as 
healthy control by a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) 
algorithm.

Computational models of visual attention in artificial intelligence and robotics 
have been inspired by the concept of a saliency map. These models account for 
the mutual information between the (current) visual information and its 
estimated causes. However, they fail to consider the circular causality between 
perception and action. In other words, they do not consider where to sample 
next, given current beliefs. Here, we reclaim salience as an active inference 
process that relies on two basic principles: uncertainty minimization and 
rhythmic scheduling. For this, we make a distinction between attention and 
salience. Briefly, we associate attention with precision control, i.e., the 
confidence with which beliefs can be updated given sampled sensory data, and 
salience with uncertainty minimization that underwrites the selection of future 
sensory data. Using this, we propose a new account of attention based on 
rhythmic precision-modulation and discuss its potential in robotics, providing 
numerical experiments that showcase its advantages for state and noise 
estimation, system identification and action selection for informative path 
planning.

Precision psychiatry is attracting increasing attention lately as a recognized 
priority. One of the goals of precision psychiatry is to develop tools capable 
of aiding a clinically informed psychiatric diagnosis objectively. Cognitive, 
inflammatory and immunological factors are altered in both bipolar disorder (BD) 
and schizophrenia (SZ), however, most of these alterations do not respect 
diagnostic boundaries from a phenomenological perspective and possess great 
variability in different individuals with the same phenotypic diagnosis and, 
consequently, none so far has proven to have the ability of reliably aiding in 
the differential diagnosis of BD and SZ. We developed a probabilistic 
multi-domain data integration model consisting of immune and inflammatory 
biomarkers in peripheral blood and cognitive biomarkers using machine learning 
to predict diagnosis of BD and SZ. A total of 416 participants, being 323, 372, 
and 279 subjects for blood, cognition and combined biomarkers analysis, 
respectively. Our multi-domain model performances for the BD vs. control 
(sensitivity 80% and specificity 71%) and for the SZ vs. control (sensitivity 
84% and specificity 81%) pairs were high in general, however, our multi-domain 
model had only moderate performance for the differential diagnosis of BD and SZ 
(sensitivity 71% and specificity 73%). In conclusion, our results show that the 
diagnosis of BD and of SZ, and that the differential diagnosis of BD and SZ can 
be predicted with possible clinical utility by a computational machine learning 
algorithm employing blood and cognitive biomarkers, and that their integration 
in a multi-domain outperforms algorithms based in only one domain. Independent 
studies are needed to validate these findings.

PURPOSE: The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon was 
developed to standardize mammographic reporting to assess cancer risk and 
facilitate the decision to biopsy. Because of substantial interobserver 
variability in the application of the BI-RADS lexicon, the decision to biopsy 
varies greatly and results in overdiagnosis and excessive biopsies. The 
false-positive rate from mammograms is estimated to be 7% to approximately 10% 
overall, but within the BI-RADS 4 category, it is greater than 70%. Therefore, 
we developed the Breast Cancer Risk Calculator (BRISK) to target a 
well-characterized and specific patient subgroup (BI-RADS 4) rather than a broad 
heterogeneous group in assessing breast cancer risk.
METHODS: BRISK provides a novel precise risk assessment model to reduce 
overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies. It was developed by applying natural 
language processing and deep learning methods on 5,147 patient records archived 
in the Houston Methodist systemwide data warehouse from 2006 to May 2015, 
including imaging and pathology reports, mammographic images, and patient 
demographics. Key characteristics for BI-RADS 4 patients were collected and 
computed to output an index measure for biopsy recommendation that is clinically 
relevant and informative and improves upon the traditional BI-RADS 4 scores.
RESULTS: For the validation set, we assessed data from 1,247 BI-RADS 4 patients, 
including mammographic images and medical reports. The BRISK model sensitivity 
to predict malignancy was 100%, whereas the specificity was 74%. The total 
accuracy of our implemented model in BRISK was 81%. Overall area under the curve 
was 0.93.
CONCLUSION: BRISK for abnormal mammogram uses integrative artificial 
intelligence technology and has demonstrated high sensitivity in the prediction 
of malignancy. Prospective evaluation is under way and can lead to improvement 
in patient-physician engagement in making informed decisions with regard to 
biopsy.

BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a final common manifestation of 
heterogenous etiologies. Adverse outcomes highlight the need for disease 
stratification beyond ejection fraction.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify novel, reproducible 
subphenotypes of DCM using multiparametric data for improved patient 
stratification.
METHODS: Longitudinal, observational UK-derivation (n = 426; median age 54 
years; 67% men) and Dutch-validation (n = 239; median age 56 years; 64% men) 
cohorts of DCM patients (enrolled 2009-2016) with clinical, genetic, 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance, and proteomic assessments. Machine learning 
with profile regression identified novel disease subtypes. Penalized multinomial 
logistic regression was used for validation. Nested Cox models compared novel 
groupings to conventional risk measures. Primary composite outcome was 
cardiovascular death, heart failure, or arrhythmia events (median follow-up 4 
years).
RESULTS: In total, 3 novel DCM subtypes were identified: profibrotic metabolic, 
mild nonfibrotic, and biventricular impairment. Prognosis differed between 
subtypes in both the derivation (P < 0.0001) and validation cohorts. The novel 
profibrotic metabolic subtype had more diabetes, universal myocardial fibrosis, 
preserved right ventricular function, and elevated creatinine. For clinical 
application, 5 variables were sufficient for classification (left and right 
ventricular end-systolic volumes, left atrial volume, myocardial fibrosis, and 
creatinine). Adding the novel DCM subtype improved the C-statistic from 0.60 to 
0.76. Interleukin-4 receptor-alpha was identified as a novel prognostic 
biomarker in derivation (HR: 3.6; 95% CI: 1.9-6.5; P = 0.00002) and validation 
cohorts (HR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.3-2.8; P = 0.00005).
CONCLUSIONS: Three reproducible, mechanistically distinct DCM subtypes were 
identified using widely available clinical and biological data, adding 
prognostic value to traditional risk models. They may improve patient selection 
for novel interventions, thereby enabling precision medicine.

In this perspective paper, we want to highlight the potential benefits of 
incorporating digital twins to support better dementia care. In particular, we 
assert that, by doing so, it is possible to ensure greater precision regarding 
dementia care while simultaneously enhancing personalization. Digital twins have 
been used successfully in manufacturing to enable better prediction and 
tailoring of solutions to meet required needs, and thereby have enabled more 
effective and efficient deployment of resources. We develop a model for digital 
twin in the healthcare domain as a clinical decision support tool by 
extrapolating its current uses from the manufacturing domain. We illustrate the 
power of the developed model in the context of dementia. Given the rapid rise of 
chronic conditions and the pressures on healthcare delivery to provide high 
quality, cost-effective care anywhere and anytime, we assert that such an 
approach is consistent with a value-based healthcare philosophy and thus 
important as the numbers of people with dementia continues to grow exponentially 
and this pressing healthcare issue is yet to be optimally addressed. Further 
research and development in this rapidly evolving domain is a strategic priority 
for ensuring the delivery of superior dementia care.

Physiatry is a medical specialty focused on improving functional outcomes in 
patients with a variety of medical conditions that affect the brain, spinal 
cord, peripheral nerves, muscles, bones, joints, ligaments, and tendons. Social 
determinants of health (SDH) play a key role in determining therapeutic process 
and patient functional outcomes. Big data and precision medicine have been used 
in other fields and to some extent in physiatry to predict patient outcomes, 
however many challenges remain. The interplay between SDH and physiatry outcomes 
is highly variable depending on different phases of care, and more favorable 
patient profiles in acute care may be less favorable in the outpatient setting. 
Furthermore, SDH influence which treatments or interventional procedures are 
accessible to the patient and thus determine outcomes. This opinion paper 
describes utility of existing datasets in combination with novel data such as 
movement, gait patterning and patient perceived outcomes could be analyzed with 
artificial intelligence methods to determine the best treatment plan for 
individual patients in order to achieve maximal functional capacity.

Coffee With a Hint of Data: Towards Using Data-Driven Approaches in Personalised 
Long-Term Interactions.

While earlier research in human-robot interaction pre-dominantly uses rule-based 
architectures for natural language interaction, these approaches are not 
flexible enough for long-term interactions in the real world due to the large 
variation in user utterances. In contrast, data-driven approaches map the user 
input to the agent output directly, hence, provide more flexibility with these 
variations without requiring any set of rules. However, data-driven approaches 
are generally applied to single dialogue exchanges with a user and do not build 
up a memory over long-term conversation with different users, whereas long-term 
interactions require remembering users and their preferences incrementally and 
continuously and recalling previous interactions with users to adapt and 
personalise the interactions, known as the lifelong learning problem. In 
addition, it is desirable to learn user preferences from a few samples of 
interactions (i.e., few-shot learning). These are known to be challenging 
problems in machine learning, while they are trivial for rule-based approaches, 
creating a trade-off between flexibility and robustness. Correspondingly, in 
this work, we present the text-based Barista Datasets generated to evaluate the 
potential of data-driven approaches in generic and personalised long-term 
human-robot interactions with simulated real-world problems, such as recognition 
errors, incorrect recalls and changes to the user preferences. Based on these 
datasets, we explore the performance and the underlying inaccuracies of the 
state-of-the-art data-driven dialogue models that are strong baselines in other 
domains of personalisation in single interactions, namely Supervised Embeddings, 
Sequence-to-Sequence, End-to-End Memory Network, Key-Value Memory Network, and 
Generative Profile Memory Network. The experiments show that while data-driven 
approaches are suitable for generic task-oriented dialogue and real-time 
interactions, no model performs sufficiently well to be deployed in personalised 
long-term interactions in the real world, because of their inability to learn 
and use new identities, and their poor performance in recalling user-related 
data.

Progress in developing personalised care for mental disorders is supported by 
numerous proof-of-concept machine learning studies in the area of risk 
assessment, diagnostics and precision prescribing. Most of these studies 
primarily use clinical data, but models might benefit from additional 
neuroimaging, blood and genetic data to improve accuracy. Combined, multimodal 
models might offer potential for stratification of patients for treatment. 
Clinical implementation of machine learning is impeded by a lack of wider 
generalisability, with efforts primarily focused on psychosis and dementia. 
Studies across all diagnostic groups should work to test the robustness of 
machine learning models, which is an essential first step to clinical 
implementation, and then move to prospective clinical validation. Models need to 
exceed clinicians' heuristics to be useful, and safe, in routine 
decision-making. Engagement of clinicians, researchers and patients in 
digitalisation and 'big data' approaches are vital to allow the generation and 
accessibility of large, longitudinal, prospective data needed for precision 
psychiatry to be applied into real-world psychiatric care.

The Precision Medicine Initiative is a multicenter effort aiming at formulating 
personalized treatments leveraging on individual patient data (clinical, genome 
sequence and functional genomic data) together with the information in large 
knowledge bases (KBs) that integrate genome annotation, disease association 
studies, electronic health records and other data types. The biomedical 
literature provides a rich foundation for populating these KBs, reporting 
genetic and molecular interactions that provide the scaffold for the cellular 
regulatory systems and detailing the influence of genetic variants in these 
interactions. The goal of BioCreative VI Precision Medicine Track was to extract 
this particular type of information and was organized in two tasks: (i) document 
triage task, focused on identifying scientific literature containing 
experimentally verified protein-protein interactions (PPIs) affected by genetic 
mutations and (ii) relation extraction task, focused on extracting the affected 
interactions (protein pairs). To assist system developers and task participants, 
a large-scale corpus of PubMed documents was manually annotated for this task. 
Ten teams worldwide contributed 22 distinct text-mining models for the document 
triage task, and six teams worldwide contributed 14 different text-mining 
systems for the relation extraction task. When comparing the text-mining system 
predictions with human annotations, for the triage task, the best F-score was 
69.06%, the best precision was 62.89%, the best recall was 98.0% and the best 
average precision was 72.5%. For the relation extraction task, when taking 
homologous genes into account, the best F-score was 37.73%, the best precision 
was 46.5% and the best recall was 54.1%. Submitted systems explored a wide range 
of methods, from traditional rule-based, statistical and machine learning 
systems to state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Given the level of 
participation and the individual team results we find the precision medicine 
track to be successful in engaging the text-mining research community. In the 
meantime, the track produced a manually annotated corpus of 5509 PubMed 
documents developed by BioGRID curators and relevant for precision medicine. The 
data set is freely available to the community, and the specific interactions 
have been integrated into the BioGRID data set. In addition, this challenge 
provided the first results of automatically identifying PubMed articles that 
describe PPI affected by mutations, as well as extracting the affected relations 
from those articles. Still, much progress is needed for computer-assisted 
precision medicine text mining to become mainstream. Future work should focus on 
addressing the remaining technical challenges and incorporating the practical 
benefits of text-mining tools into real-world precision medicine 
information-related curation.

Micropropagation techniques offer opportunity to proliferate, maintain, and 
study dynamic plant responses in highly controlled environments without 
confounding external influences, forming the basis for many biotechnological 
applications. With medicinal and recreational interests for Cannabis sativa L. 
growing, research related to the optimization of in vitro practices is needed to 
improve current methods while boosting our understanding of the underlying 
physiological processes. Unfortunately, due to the exorbitantly large array of 
factors influencing tissue culture, existing approaches to optimize in vitro 
methods are tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, there is great potential to 
use new computational methodologies for analyzing data to develop improved 
protocols more efficiently. Here, we first tested the effects of light qualities 
using assorted combinations of Red, Blue, Far Red, and White spanning 0-100 
μmol/m2/s in combination with sucrose concentrations ranging from 1 to 6% (w/v), 
totaling 66 treatments, on in vitro shoot growth, root development, number of 
nodes, shoot emergence, and canopy surface area. Collected data were then 
assessed using multilayer perceptron (MLP), generalized regression neural 
network (GRNN), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to model and 
predict in vitro Cannabis growth and development. Based on the results, GRNN had 
better performance than MLP or ANFIS and was consequently selected to link 
different optimization algorithms [genetic algorithm (GA), biogeography-based 
optimization (BBO), interior search algorithm (ISA), and symbiotic organisms 
search (SOS)] for prediction of optimal light levels (quality/intensity) and 
sucrose concentration for various applications. Predictions of in vitro 
conditions to refine growth responses were subsequently tested in a validation 
experiment and data showed no significant differences between predicted 
optimized values and observed data. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential 
of machine learning and optimization algorithms to predict the most favorable 
light combinations and sucrose levels to elicit specific developmental 
responses. Based on these, recommendations of light and carbohydrate levels to 
promote specific developmental outcomes for in vitro Cannabis are suggested. 
Ultimately, this work showcases the importance of light quality and carbohydrate 
supply in directing plant development as well as the power of machine learning 
approaches to investigate complex interactions in plant tissue culture.

including genetic and non-genetic factors. Multiple linear regression (LR) is 
known as a conventional method to develop predictive models. Recently, machine 
learning approaches have been extensively implemented for warfarin dosing due to 
the hypothesis of non-linear association between covariates and stable warfarin 
dose.
OBJECTIVE: To extend the multiple linear regression algorithm for personalized 
warfarin dosing in a Korean population and compare with a machine 
learning--based algorithm.
METHOD: From this cohort study, we collected information on 650 patients taking 
warfarin who achieved steady state including demographic information, 
indications, comorbidities, comedications, habits, and genetic factors. The 
dataset was randomly split into training set (90%) and test set (10%). The LR 
and machine learning (gradient boosting machine [GBM]) models were developed on 
the training set and were evaluated on the test set.
RESULT: LR and GBM models were comparable in terms of accuracy of ideal dose 
(75.38% and 73.85%), correlation (0.77 and 0.73), mean absolute error 
(0.58 mg/day and 0.64 mg/day), and root mean square error (0.82 mg/day and 
0.9 mg/day), respectively. VKORC1 genotype, CYP2C9 genotype, age, and weight 
were the highest contributors and could obtain 80% of maximum performance in 
both models.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that our LR and GMB models are satisfactory to 
predict warfarin dose in our dataset. Both models showed similar performance and 
feature contribution characteristics. LR may be the appropriate model due to its 
simplicity and interpretability.

Advancing frontiers of clinical research, we discuss the need for intelligent 
health systems to support a deeper investigation of COVID-19. We hypothesize 
that the convergence of the healthcare data and staggering developments in 
artificial intelligence have the potential to elevate the recovery process with 
diagnostic and predictive analysis to identify major causes of mortality, 
modifiable risk factors and actionable information that supports the early 
detection and prevention of COVID-19. However, current constraints include 
the recruitment of COVID-19 patients for research; translational integration of 
electronic health records and diversified public datasets; and the development 
of artificial intelligence systems for data-intensive computational modeling to 
assist clinical decision making. We propose a novel nexus of machine learning 
algorithms to examine COVID-19 data granularity from population studies to 
subgroups stratification and ensure best modeling strategies within the data 
continuum.

Unravelling the secrets of wild animals is one of the biggest challenges in 
ecology, with bio-logging (i.e., the use of animal-borne loggers or bio-loggers) 
playing a pivotal role in tackling this challenge. Bio-logging allows us to 
observe many aspects of animals' lives, including their behaviours, physiology, 
social interactions, and external environment. However, bio-loggers have short 
runtimes when collecting data from resource-intensive (high-cost) sensors. This 
study proposes using AI on board video-loggers in order to use low-cost sensors 
(e.g., accelerometers) to automatically detect and record complex target 
behaviours that are of interest, reserving their devices' limited resources for 
just those moments. We demonstrate our method on bio-loggers attached to 
seabirds including gulls and shearwaters, where it captured target videos with 
15 times the precision of a baseline periodic-sampling method. Our work will 
provide motivation for more widespread adoption of AI in bio-loggers, helping us 
to shed light onto until now hidden aspects of animals' lives.

INTRODUCTION: Establishment of a cell classification platform for evaluation and 
selection of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is of great importance to 
assure the efficacy and safety of cell-based therapy. In our previous work, we 
introduced a discriminant function that evaluates pluripotency from the cells' 
glycome. However, it is not yet suitable for general use.
METHODS: The current study aims to establish a high-precision cell 
classification platform introducing supervised machine learning and test the 
platform on glycome analysis as a proof-of-concept study. We employed linear 
classification and neural network to the lectin microarray data from 1577 human 
cells and categorized them into five classes including hPSCs.
RESULTS: The linear-classification-based model and the neural-network-based 
model successfully predicted the sample type with accuracies of 89% and 97%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of the high recognition accuracies and the small amount of 
computing resources required for these analyses, our platform can be a high 
precision conventional cell classification system for hPSCs.

The evaluation of COVID-19 prediction precision with a Lyapunov-like exponent.

In the field of machine learning, building models and measuring their 
performance are two equally important tasks. Currently, measures of precision of 
regression models' predictions are usually based on the notion of mean error, 
where by error we mean a deviation of a prediction from an observation. However, 
these mean based measures of models' performance have two drawbacks. Firstly, 
they ignore the length of the prediction, which is crucial when dealing with 
chaotic systems, where a small deviation at the beginning grows exponentially 
with time. Secondly, these measures are not suitable in situations where a 
prediction is made for a specific point in time (e.g. a date), since they 
average all errors from the start of the prediction to its end. Therefore, the 
aim of this paper is to propose a new measure of models' prediction precision, a 
divergence exponent, based on the notion of the Lyapunov exponent which 
overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks. The proposed approach enables the 
measuring and comparison of models' prediction precision for time series with 
unequal length and a given target date in the framework of chaotic phenomena. 
Application of the divergence exponent to the evaluation of models' accuracy is 
demonstrated by two examples and then a set of selected predictions of COVID-19 
spread from other studies is evaluated to show its potential.

Precision medicine relies upon artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies 
that raise ethical and practical concerns. In this study, we developed and 
validated a measure of parental openness and concerns with AI-driven 
technologies in their child's healthcare. In this cross-sectional survey, we 
enrolled parents of children <18 years in 2 rounds for exploratory (n = 418) and 
confirmatory (n = 386) factor analysis. We developed a 12-item measure of 
parental openness to AI-driven technologies, and a 33-item measure identifying 
concerns that parents found important when considering these technologies. We 
also evaluated associations between openness and attitudes, beliefs, personality 
traits, and demographics. Parents (N = 804) reported mean openness to AI-driven 
technologies of M = 3.4/5, SD = 0.9. We identified seven concerns that parents 
considered important when evaluating these technologies: quality/accuracy, 
privacy, shared decision making, convenience, cost, human element of care, and 
social justice. In multivariable linear regression, parental openness was 
positively associated with quality (beta = 0.23), convenience (beta = 0.16), and 
cost (beta = 0.11), as well as faith in technology (beta = 0.23) and trust in 
health information systems (beta = 0.12). Parental openness was negatively 
associated with the perceived importance of shared decision making (beta = 
-0.16) and being female (beta = -0.12). Developers might support parental 
openness by addressing these concerns during the development and implementation 
of novel AI-driven technologies.

It is becoming clear that the human gut microbiome is critical to health and 
well-being, with increasing evidence demonstrating that dysbiosis can promote 
disease. Increasingly, precision probiotics are being investigated as 
investigational drug products for restoration of healthy microbiome balance. To 
reach the distal gut alive where the density of microbiota is highest, oral 
probiotics should be protected from harsh conditions during transit through the 
stomach and small intestines. At present, few probiotic formulations are 
designed with this delivery strategy in mind. This study employs an emerging 
machine learning (ML) technique, known as active ML, to predict how excipients 
at pharmaceutically relevant concentrations affect the intestinal proliferation 
of a common probiotic, Lactobacillus paracasei. Starting with a labelled dataset 
of just 6 bacteria-excipient interactions, active ML was able to predict the 
effects of a further 111 excipients using uncertainty sampling. The average 
certainty of the final model was 67.70% and experimental validation demonstrated 
that 3/4 excipient-probiotic interactions could be correctly predicted. The 
model can be used to enable superior probiotic delivery to maximise 
proliferation in vivo and marks the first use of active ML in microbiome 
science.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current tools to proactively guide and individualize 
immunosuppression in solid organ transplantation are limited. Despite continued 
improvements in posttransplant outcomes, the adverse effects of 
over-immunosuppression or under-immunosuppression are common. The present review 
is intended to highlight recent advances in individualized immunosuppression.
RECENT FINDINGS: There has been a great focus on genomic information to predict 
drug dose requirements, specifically on single nucleotide polymorphisms of 
CYP3A5 and ABCB1. Furthermore, biomarker studies have developed ways to better 
predict clinical outcomes, such as graft rejection.
SUMMARY: The integration of advanced computing tools, such as artificial neural 
networks and machine learning, with genome sequencing has led to intriguing 
findings on individual or group-specific dosing requirements. Rapid computing 
allows for processing of data and discovering otherwise undetected clinical 
patterns. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A5 and ABCB1 have yielded results to 
suggest varying dose requirements correlated with race and sex. Newly proposed 
biomarkers offer precise and noninvasive ways to monitor patient's status. 
Cell-free DNA quantitation is increasingly explored as an indicator of allograft 
injury and rejection, which can help avoid unneeded biopsies and more frequently 
monitor graft function.

To support point-of-care decision making by presenting outcomes of past 
treatment choices for cohorts of similar patients based on observational data 
from electronic health records (EHRs), a machine-learning precision cohort 
treatment option (PCTO) workflow consisting of (1) data extraction, (2) 
similarity model training, (3) precision cohort identification, and (4) 
treatment options analysis was developed. The similarity model is used to 
dynamically create a cohort of similar patients, to inform clinical decisions 
about an individual patient. The workflow was implemented using EHR data from a 
large health care provider for three different highly prevalent chronic 
diseases: hypertension (HTN), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 
hyperlipidemia (HL). A retrospective analysis demonstrated that treatment 
options with better outcomes were available for a majority of cases (75%, 74%, 
85% for HTN, T2DM, HL, respectively). The models for HTN and T2DM were deployed 
in a pilot study with primary care physicians using it during clinic visits. A 
novel data-analytic workflow was developed to create patient-similarity models 
that dynamically generate personalized treatment insights at the point-of-care. 
By leveraging both knowledge-driven treatment guidelines and data-driven EHR 
data, physicians can incorporate real-world evidence in their medical 
decision-making process when considering treatment options for individual 
patients.

We present an end-to-end smart harvesting solution for precision agriculture. 
Our proposed pipeline begins with yield estimation that is done through the use 
of object detection and tracking to count fruit within a video. We use and train 
You Only Look Once model (YOLO) on video clips of apples, oranges and pumpkins. 
The bounding boxes obtained through objection detection are used as an input to 
our selected tracking model, DeepSORT. The original version of DeepSORT is 
unusable with fruit data, as the appearance feature extractor only works with 
people. We implement ResNet as DeepSORT's new feature extractor, which is 
lightweight, accurate and generically works on different fruits. Our yield 
estimation module shows accuracy between 91-95% on real footage of apple trees. 
Our modification successfully works for counting oranges and pumpkins, with an 
accuracy of 79% and 93.9% with no need for training. Our framework additionally 
includes a visualization of the yield. This is done through the incorporation of 
geospatial data. We also propose a mechanism to annotate a set of frames with a 
respective GPS coordinate. During counting, the count within the set of frames 
and the matching GPS coordinate are recorded, which we then visualize on a map. 
We leverage this information to propose an optimal container placement solution. 
Our proposed solution involves minimizing the number of containers to place 
across the field before harvest, based on a set of constraints. This acts as a 
decision support system for the farmer to make efficient plans for logistics, 
such as labor, equipment and gathering paths before harvest. Our work serves as 
a blueprint for future agriculture decision support systems that can aid in many 
other aspects of farming.

Precision medicine in psychiatry is based on the identification of homogeneous 
subgroups of patients with the help of biosignatures-sets of biomarkers-in order 
to enhance diagnosis, stratification of patients, prognosis, evaluation, and 
prediction of treatment response. Within the broad domain of biomarker 
discovery, we propose retinal electrophysiology as a tool for identification of 
biosignatures. The retina is a window to the brain and provides an indirect 
access to brain functioning in psychiatric disorders. The retina is organized in 
layers of specialized neurons which share similar functional properties with 
brain neurons. The functioning of these neurons can be evaluated by 
electrophysiological techniques named electroretinogram (ERG). Since the study 
of retinal functioning gives a unique opportunity to have an indirect access to 
brain neurons, retinal dysfunctions observed in psychiatric disorders inform on 
brain abnormalities. Up to now, retinal dysfunctions observed in psychiatric 
disorders provide indicators for diagnosis, identification of subgroups of 
patients, prognosis, evaluation, and prediction of treatment response. The use 
of signal processing and machine learning applied on ERG data enhances retinal 
markers extraction, thus providing robust, reproducible, and reliable retinal 
electrophysiological markers to identify biosignatures in precision psychiatry. 
We propose that retinal electrophysiology may be considered as a new approach in 
the domain of electrophysiology and could now be added to the routine 
evaluations in psychiatric disorders. Retinal electrophysiology may provide, in 
combination with other approaches and techniques, sets of biomarkers to produce 
biosignatures in mental health.

Ultrasomics is the science of transforming digitally encrypted medical 
ultrasound images that hold information related to tumor pathophysiology into 
mineable high-dimensional data. Ultrasomics data have the potential to uncover 
disease characteristics that are not found with the naked eye. The task of 
ultrasomics is to quantify the state of diseases using distinctive imaging 
algorithms and thereby provide valuable information for personalized medicine. 
Ultrasomics is a powerful tool in oncology but can also be applied to other 
medical problems for which a disease is imaged. To date there is no 
comprehensive review focusing on ultrasomics. Here, we describe how ultrasomics 
works and its capability in diagnosing disease in different organs, including 
breast, liver, and thyroid. Its pitfalls, challenges and opportunities are also 
discussed.

Mixed-Precision Kernel Recursive Least Squares.

Lee J, Nikolopoulos DS, Vandierendonck H.

Kernel recursive least squares (KRLS) is a widely used online machine learning 
algorithm for time series predictions. In this article, we present the 
mixed-precision KRLS, producing equivalent prediction accuracy to 
double-precision KRLS with a higher training throughput and a lower memory 
footprint. The mixed-precision KRLS applies single-precision arithmetic to the 
computation components being not only numerically resilient but also 
computationally intensive. Our mixed-precision KRLS demonstrates the 1.32, 1.15, 
1.29, 1.09, and 1.08× training throughput improvements using 24.95%, 24.74%, 
24.89%, 24.48%, and 24.20% less memory footprint without losing any prediction 
accuracy compared to double-precision KRLS for a 3-D nonlinear regression, a 
Lorenz chaotic time series, a Mackey-Glass chaotic time series, a sunspot number 
time series, and a sea surface temperature time series, respectively.

Accurate and individualized prediction of response to therapies is central to 
precision medicine. However, because of the generally complex and multifaceted 
nature of clinical drug response, realizing this vision is highly challenging, 
requiring integrating different data types from the same individual into one 
prediction model. We used the anti-epileptic drug brivaracetam as a case study 
and combine a hybrid data/knowledge-driven feature extraction with machine 
learning to systematically integrate clinical and genetic data from a clinical 
discovery dataset (n = 235 patients). We constructed a model that successfully 
predicts clinical drug response [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.76] and show 
that even with limited sample size, integrating high-dimensional genetics data 
with clinical data can inform drug response prediction. After further validation 
on data collected from an independently conducted clinical study (AUC = 0.75), 
we extensively explore our model to gain insights into the determinants of drug 
response, and identify various clinical and genetic characteristics predisposing 
to poor response. Finally, we assess the potential impact of our model on 
clinical trial design and demonstrate that, by enriching for probable 
responders, significant reductions in clinical study sizes may be achieved. To 
our knowledge, our model represents the first retrospectively validated machine 
learning model linking drug mechanism of action and the genetic, clinical and 
demographic background in epilepsy patients to clinical drug response. Hence, it 
provides a blueprint for how machine learning-based multimodal data integration 
can act as a driver in achieving the goals of precision medicine in fields such 
as neurology.

BACKGROUND: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare connective tissue disease that 
can affect different organs and has extremely heterogenous presentations. This 
complexity makes it difficult to perform an early diagnosis and a subsequent 
subclassification of the disease. This hinders a personalized approach in 
clinical practice. In this context, machine learning (ML), a branch of 
artificial intelligence (AI), is able to recognize relationships in data and 
predict outcomes.
METHODS: Here, we performed a narrative review concerning the application of ML 
in SSc to define the state of art and evaluate its role in a precision medicine 
context.
RESULTS: Currently, ML has been used to stratify SSc patients and identify those 
at high risk of severe complications. Additionally, ML may be useful in the 
early detection of organ involvement. Furthermore, ML might have a role in 
target therapy approach and in predicting drug response.
CONCLUSION: Available evidence about the utility of ML in SSc is sparse but 
promising. Future improvements in this field could result in a big step toward 
precision medicine. Further research is needed to define ML application in 
clinical practice.

Three-dimensional protein structural data at the molecular level are pivotal for 
successful precision medicine. Such data are crucial not only for discovering 
drugs that act to block the active site of the target mutant protein but also 
for clarifying to the patient and the clinician how the mutations harbored by 
the patient work. The relative paucity of structural data reflects their cost, 
challenges in their interpretation, and lack of clinical guidelines for their 
utilization. Rapid technological advancements in experimental high-resolution 
structural determination increasingly generate structures. Computationally, 
modeling algorithms, including molecular dynamics simulations, are becoming more 
powerful, as are compute-intensive hardware, particularly graphics processing 
units, overlapping with the inception of the exascale era. Accessible, freely 
available, and detailed structural and dynamical data can be merged with big 
data to powerfully transform personalizedpharmacology. Here we review protein 
and emerging genome high-resolution data, along with means, applications, and 
examples underscoring their usefulness in precision medicine.

With the rapid development of new technologies, including artificial 
intelligence and genome sequencing, radiogenomics has emerged as a 
state-of-the-art science in the field of individualized medicine. Radiogenomics 
combines a large volume of quantitative data extracted from medical images with 
individual genomic phenotypes and constructs a prediction model through deep 
learning to stratify patients, guide therapeutic strategies, and evaluate 
clinical outcomes. Recent studies of various types of tumors demonstrate the 
predictive value of radiogenomics. And some of the issues in the radiogenomic 
analysis and the solutions from prior works are presented. Although the workflow 
criteria and international agreed guidelines for statistical methods need to be 
confirmed, radiogenomics represents a repeatable and cost-effective approach for 
the detection of continuous changes and is a promising surrogate for invasive 
interventions. Therefore, radiogenomics could facilitate computer-aided 
diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of the prognosis in patients with tumors in 
the routine clinical setting. Here, we summarize the integrated process of 
radiogenomics and introduce the crucial strategies and statistical algorithms 
involved in current studies.

BACKGROUND: An accurate prediction of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) origins can 
optimize the strategy of ablation, and facilitate the procedure.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a machine learning model from surface ECG 
to predict VA origins.
METHODS: We obtained 3628 waves of ventricular premature complex (VPC) from 731 
patients. We chose to include all signal information from 12 ECG leads for model 
input. A model is composed of two groups of convolutional neural network (CNN) 
layers. We chose around 13% of all the data for model testing and 10% for 
validation.
RESULTS: In the first step, we trained a model for binary classification of VA 
source from the left or right side of the chamber with an area under the curve 
(AUC) of 0.963. With a threshold of 0.739, the sensitivity and specification are 
90.7% and 92.3% for identifying left side VA. Then, we obtained the second model 
for predicting VA from the LV summit with AUC is 0.998. With a threshold of 
0.739, the sensitivity and specificity are 100% and 98% for the LV summit.
CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning algorithm of surface ECG facilitates the 
localization of VPC, especially for the LV summit, which might optimize the 
ablation strategy.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgency of addressing an 
epidemic of obesity and associated inflammatory illnesses. Previous studies have 
demonstrated that interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
and lifestyle interventions such as food and exercise may vary metabolic 
outcomes, contributing to obesity. However, there is a paucity of research 
relating outcomes from digital therapeutics to the inclusion of genetic data in 
care interventions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe and model the weight loss of participants 
enrolled in a precision digital weight loss program informed by the machine 
learning analysis of their data, including genomic data. It was hypothesized 
that weight loss models would exhibit a better fit when incorporating genomic 
data versus demographic and engagement variables alone.
METHODS: A cohort of 393 participants enrolled in Digbi Health's personalized 
digital care program for 120 days was analyzed retrospectively. The care 
protocol used participant data to inform precision coaching by mobile app and 
personal coach. Linear regression models were fit of weight loss (pounds lost 
and percentage lost) as a function of demographic and behavioral engagement 
variables. Genomic-enhanced models were built by adding 197 SNPs from 
participant genomic data as predictors and refitted using Lasso regression on 
SNPs for variable selection. Success or failure logistic regression models were 
also fit with and without genomic data.
RESULTS: Overall, 72.0% (n=283) of the 393 participants in this cohort lost 
weight, whereas 17.3% (n=68) maintained stable weight. A total of 142 
participants lost 5% bodyweight within 120 days. Models described the impact of 
demographic and clinical factors, behavioral engagement, and genomic risk on 
weight loss. Incorporating genomic predictors improved the mean squared error of 
weight loss models (pounds lost and percent) from 70 to 60 and 16 to 13, 
respectively. The logistic model improved the pseudo R2 value from 0.193 to 
0.285. Gender, engagement, and specific SNPs were significantly associated with 
weight loss. SNPs within genes involved in metabolic pathways processing food 
and regulating fat storage were associated with weight loss in this cohort: 
rs17300539_G (insulin resistance and monounsaturated fat metabolism), 
rs2016520_C (BMI, waist circumference, and cholesterol metabolism), and 
rs4074995_A (calcium-potassium transport and serum calcium levels). The models 
described greater average weight loss for participants with more risk alleles. 
Notably, coaching for dietary modification was personalized to these genetic 
risks.
CONCLUSIONS: Including genomic information when modeling outcomes of a digital 
precision weight loss program greatly enhanced the model accuracy. Interpretable 
weight loss models indicated the efficacy of coaching informed by participants' 
genomic risk, accompanied by active engagement of participants in their own 
success. Although large-scale validation is needed, our study preliminarily 
supports precision dietary interventions for weight loss using genetic risk, 
with digitally delivered recommendations alongside health coaching to improve 
intervention efficacy.

In recent years, the learning efficacy of online to offline (O2O) teaching 
methods seems to outperform traditional teaching methods in the field of 
education. Students can use a small private online course (SPOC) teaching 
platform to preview class-related materials, learn basic knowledge, and enhance 
the practical experience of system development in offline courses. The research 
team applied an artificial intelligence (AI) precision education strategy to 
design a teaching experiment that evaluated whether this approach may lead to 
better learning outcomes. In addition to questionnaire surveys to ascertain 
students' attitudes toward and their satisfaction with learning, this study 
employed in-depth interviews to understand a potential influence on changes in 
teachers' curriculum design and teaching approaches when SPOCs was integrated 
into the traditional university classroom, as well as the impact of the AI 
precision education model. The results showed that the AI precision education 
model may facilitate students' learning experience and enhance student 
achievement.

BACKGROUND: One component of precision medicine is to construct prediction 
models with their predicitve ability as high as possible, e.g. to enable 
individual risk prediction. In genetic epidemiology, complex diseases like 
coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 2 diabetes, have a 
polygenic basis and a common assumption is that biological and genetic features 
affect the outcome under consideration via interactions. In the case of omics 
data, the use of standard approaches such as generalized linear models may be 
suboptimal and machine learning methods are appealing to make individual 
predictions. However, most of these algorithms focus mostly on main or marginal 
effects of the single features in a dataset. On the other hand, the detection of 
interacting features is an active area of research in the realm of genetic 
epidemiology. One big class of algorithms to detect interacting features is 
based on the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR). Here, we further 
develop the model-based MDR (MB-MDR), a powerful extension of the original MDR 
algorithm, to enable interaction empowered individual prediction.
RESULTS: Using a comprehensive simulation study we show that our new algorithm 
(median AUC: 0.66) can use information hidden in interactions and outperforms 
two other state-of-the-art algorithms, namely the Random Forest (median AUC: 
0.54) and Elastic Net (median AUC: 0.50), if interactions are present in a 
scenario of two pairs of two features having small effects. The performance of 
these algorithms is comparable if no interactions are present. Further, we show 
that our new algorithm is applicable to real data by comparing the performance 
of the three algorithms on a dataset of rheumatoid arthritis cases and healthy 
controls. As our new algorithm is not only applicable to biological/genetic data 
but to all datasets with discrete features, it may have practical implications 
in other research fields where interactions between features have to be 
considered as well, and we made our method available as an R package ( 
https://github.com/imbs-hl/MBMDRClassifieR ).
CONCLUSIONS: The explicit use of interactions between features can improve the 
prediction performance and thus should be included in further attempts to move 
precision medicine forward.

PURPOSE: There is an increasing need for pedicle screw positioning while 
decreasing radiation exposure. This study compares intra-operative radiation 
dose using posterior internal fixation using impedancemetry-guided pedicle 
positioning by the Pediguard system versus standard free-hand sighting when 
surgery was performed with a trainee or expert surgeon.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using the electrical properties of bone, the Pediguard 
detects iatrogenic penetration of the pedicle wall and gives auditory feedback 
to the surgeon. A single centre, two surgeons (one experienced and the other 
novice) conducted a continuous prospective randomized study for one year. Twenty 
patients were randomized into one group (free-hand control group) receiving 
pedicle instrumentation without the use of the Pediguard and the second group 
receiving pedicle instrumentation with the use of the Pediguard. The total screw 
placement times and fluoroscopic times for each screw was recorded and pedicle 
screw position was analyzed on post-operative CT scan.
RESULTS: Among the 104 screwed pedicles, 22 unrecognized perforations were 
detected by CT scan, while no perforation signal was observed intra-operatively. 
Only one perforation was greater than 2 mm. The overall screwing time was 
4.33 ± 1.2 minutes per screw for experienced surgeon and 5.84 ± 2.5 minutes per 
screw for the novice. Pediguard did not increased significantly the time (0.3 mn 
per screw) for the experienced surgeon, but the time with Pediguard was longer 
(2 mn more per screw) for the novice surgeon, particularly at the thoracic 
level. The overall fluoroscopic average time per screw for the experienced 
surgeon is 5.8 ± 2.3 s and 10.4 ± 4.5 s for the novice surgeon. For the novice 
surgeon, radiation time reduced from 12 (without Pediguard) to 6 s (with 
Pediguard). There was no significant difference for the experienced surgeon in 
terms of improvement in radiation time with the use of Pediguard.
CONCLUSION: The overall time was longer for the novice surgeon with the 
Pediguard system, but allowed to decrease by 50% the fluoroscopy time.

Radiogenomics, a combination of "Radiomics" and "Genomics," using Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) has recently emerged as the state-of-the-art science in 
precision medicine, especially in oncology care. Radiogenomics syndicates 
large-scale quantifiable data extracted from radiological medical images 
enveloped with personalized genomic phenotypes. It fabricates a prediction model 
through various AI methods to stratify the risk of patients, monitor therapeutic 
approaches, and assess clinical outcomes. It has recently shown tremendous 
achievements in prognosis, treatment planning, survival prediction, 
heterogeneity analysis, reoccurrence, and progression-free survival for human 
cancer study. Although AI has shown immense performance in oncology care in 
various clinical aspects, it has several challenges and limitations. The 
proposed review provides an overview of radiogenomics with the viewpoints on the 
role of AI in terms of its promises for computational as well as oncological 
aspects and offers achievements and opportunities in the era of precision 
medicine. The review also presents various recommendations to diminish these 
obstacles.

The growth of multi-omic tumour profile datasets along with knowledge of genome 
regulatory networks has created an unprecedented opportunity to advance 
precision oncology. Achieving this goal requires computational methods that can 
make sense of and combine heterogeneous data sources. Interpretability and 
integration of prior knowledge is of particular relevance for genomic models to 
minimize ungeneralizable models, promote rational treatment design, and make use 
of sparse genetic mutation data. While networks have long been used to capture 
genomic interactions at the levels of genes, proteins, and pathways, the use of 
networks in precision oncology is relatively new. In this chapter, I provide an 
introduction to network-based approaches used to integrate multi-modal data 
sources for patient stratification and patient classification. There is a 
particular emphasis on methods using patient similarity networks (PSNs) as part 
of the design. I separately discuss strategies for inferring driver mutations 
from individual patient mutation data. Finally, I discuss challenges and 
opportunities the field will need to overcome to achieve its full potential, 
with an outlook towards a clinic of the future.

As the global response to COVID-19 continues, nurses will be tasked with 
appropriately triaging patients, responding to events of clinical deterioration, 
and developing family-centered plans of care within a healthcare system 
exceeding capacity. Predictive analytics monitoring, an artificial intelligence 
(AI)-based tool that translates streaming clinical data into a real-time visual 
estimation of patient risks, allows for evolving acuity assessments and 
detection of clinical deterioration while the patient is in pre-symptomatic 
states. While nurses are on the frontline for the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of 
AI-based predictive analytics monitoring may help cognitively complex clinical 
decision-making tasks and pave a pathway for early detection of patients at risk 
for decompensation. We must develop strategies and techniques to study the 
impact of AI-based technologies on patient care outcomes and the clinical 
workflow. This paper outlines key concepts for the intersection of nursing and 
precision predictive analytics monitoring.

BACKGROUND: Emerging interest in precision health and the increasing 
availability of patient- and population-level data sets present considerable 
potential to enable analytical approaches to identify and mitigate the negative 
effects of social factors on health. These issues are not satisfactorily 
addressed in typical medical care encounters, and thus, opportunities to improve 
health outcomes, reduce costs, and improve coordination of care are not 
realized. Furthermore, methodological expertise on the use of varied patient- 
and population-level data sets and machine learning to predict need for 
supplemental services is limited.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to leverage a comprehensive range of 
clinical, behavioral, social risk, and social determinants of health factors in 
order to develop decision models capable of identifying patients in need of 
various wraparound social services.
METHODS: We used comprehensive patient- and population-level data sets to build 
decision models capable of predicting need for behavioral health, dietitian, 
social work, or other social service referrals within a safety-net health system 
using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), 
sensitivity, precision, F1 score, and specificity. We also evaluated the value 
of population-level social determinants of health data sets in improving machine 
learning performance of the models.
RESULTS: Decision models for each wraparound service demonstrated performance 
measures ranging between 59.2%% and 99.3%. These results were statistically 
superior to the performance measures demonstrated by our previous models which 
used a limited data set and whose performance measures ranged from 38.2% to 
88.3% (behavioural health: F1 score P<.001, AUROC P=.01; social work: F1 score 
P<.001, AUROC P=.03; dietitian: F1 score P=.001, AUROC P=.001; other: F1 score 
P=.01, AUROC P=.02); however, inclusion of additional population-level social 
determinants of health did not contribute to any performance improvements 
(behavioural health: F1 score P=.08, AUROC P=.09; social work: F1 score P=.16, 
AUROC P=.09; dietitian: F1 score P=.08, AUROC P=.14; other: F1 score P=.33, 
AUROC P=.21) in predicting the need for referral in our population of vulnerable 
patients seeking care at a safety-net provider.
CONCLUSIONS: Precision health-enabled decision models that leverage a wide range 
of patient- and population-level data sets and advanced machine learning methods 
are capable of predicting need for various wraparound social services with good 
performance.

Precision medicine focuses on developing new treatments based on an individual's 
genetic, environmental, and lifestyle profile. While this data-driven approach 
has led to significant advances, retrieving information specific to a patient's 
condition has proved challenging for oncologists due to the large volume of 
data. In this paper, we propose the PRecIsion Medicine Robust Oncology Search 
Engine (PRIMROSE) for cancer patients that retrieves scientific articles and 
clinical trials based on a patient's condition, genetic profile, age, and 
gender. Our search engine utilizes Elasticsearch indexes for information storage 
and retrieval, and we developed a knowledge graph for query expansion in order 
to improve recall. Additionally, we experimented with machine learning and 
learning-to-rank components to the search engine and compared the results of the 
two approaches. Finally, we developed a front-facing ReactJS website and a REST 
API for connecting with our search engine. The development of this front-facing 
website allows for easy access to our system by healthcare providers.

OBJECTIVE: To present clinicians at the point-of-care with real-world data on 
the effectiveness of various treatment options in a precision cohort of patients 
closely matched to the index patient.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed disease-specific, machine-learning, 
patient-similarity models for hypertension (HTN), type II diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM), and hyperlipidemia (HL) using data on approximately 2.5 million patients 
in a large medical group practice. For each identified decision point, an 
encounter during which the patient's condition was not controlled, we compared 
the actual outcome of the treatment decision administered to that of the 
best-achieved outcome for similar patients in similar clinical situations.
RESULTS: For the majority of decision points (66.8%, 59.0%, and 83.5% for HTN, 
T2DM, and HL, respectively), there were alternative treatment options 
administered to patients in the precision cohort that resulted in a 
significantly increased proportion of patients under control than the treatment 
option chosen for the index patient. The expected percentage of patients whose 
condition would have been controlled if the best-practice treatment option had 
been chosen would have been better than the actual percentage by: 36% (65.1% vs 
48.0%, HTN), 68% (37.7% vs 22.5%, T2DM), and 138% (75.3% vs 31.7%, HL).
CONCLUSION: Clinical guidelines are primarily based on the results of randomized 
controlled trials, which apply to a homogeneous subject population. Providing 
the effectiveness of various treatment options used in a precision cohort of 
patients similar to the index patient can provide complementary information to 
tailor guideline recommendations for individual patients and potentially improve 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency catheter ablation (CA) is an efficient antiarrhythmic 
treatment with a class I indication for idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia (IVA), 
only when drugs are ineffective or have unacceptable side effects. The accurate 
prediction of the origins of IVA can significantly increase the operation 
success rate, reduce operation duration and decrease the risk of complications. 
The present work proposes an artificial intelligence-enabled ECG analysis 
algorithm to estimate possible origins of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia at a 
clinical-grade level accuracy.
METHOD: A total of 18,612 ECG recordings extracted from 545 patients who 
underwent successful CA to treat IVA were proportionally sampled into training, 
validation and testing cohorts. We designed four classification schemes 
responding to different hierarchical levels of the possible IVA origins. For 
every classification scheme, we compared 98 distinct machine learning models 
with optimized hyperparameter values obtained through extensive grid search and 
reported an optimal algorithm with the highest accuracy scores attained on the 
testing cohorts.
RESULTS: For classification scheme 4, our pioneering study designs and 
implements a machine learning-based ECG algorithm to predict 21 possible sites 
of IVA origin with an accuracy of 98.24% on a testing cohort. The accuracy and 
F1-score for the left three schemes surpassed 99%.
CONCLUSION: In this work, we developed an algorithm that precisely predicts the 
correct origins of IVA (out of 21 possible sites) and outperforms the accuracy 
of all prior studies and human experts.

Precision medicine for the treatment of glomerulonephritis: a bold goal but not

The revolution in our ability to recognize the alterations in fundamental 
biology brought about by disease has fostered a renewed interest in precision or 
personalized medicine ('the right treatment, or diagnostic test, for the right 
patient at the right time'). This nascent field has been led by oncology, 
immunohematology and infectious disease, but nephrology is catching up and 
quickly. Specific forms of glomerulonephritis (GN) thought to represent specific 
'diseases' have been 'downgraded' to 'patterns of injury'. New entities have 
emerged through the application of sophisticated molecular technologies, often 
embraced by the term 'multi-omics'. Kidney biopsies are now interpreted by 
next-generation imaging and machine learning. Many opportunities are manifest 
that will translate these remarkable developments into novel safe and effective 
treatment regimens for specific pathogenic pathways evoking GN and its 
progression to kidney failure. A few successes embolden a positive look to the 
future. A sustained and highly collaborative engagement with this new paradigm 
will be required for this field, full of hope and high expectations, to realize 
its goal of transforming glomerular therapeutics from one size fits all (or 
many) to a true individualized management principle.

The present era of precision medicine sees 'cancer' as a consequence of 
molecular derangements occurring at the commencement of the disease process, 
with morphologic changes happening much later in the process of tumorigenesis. 
Conventional imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, 
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), play an integral role in the detection of 
disease at a macroscopic level. However, molecular functional imaging (MFI) 
techniques entail the visualisation and quantification of biochemical and 
physiological processes occurring during tumorigenesis, and thus has the 
potential to play a key role in heralding the transition from the concept of 
'one size fits all' to 'precision medicine'. Integration of MFI with other 
fields of tumour biology such as genomics has spawned a novel concept called 
'radiogenomics', which could serve as an indispensable tool in translational 
cancer research. With recent advances in medical image processing, such as 
texture analysis, deep learning, and artificial intelligence (AI), the future 
seems promising; however, their clinical utility remains unproven at present. 
Despite the emergence of novel imaging biomarkers, a majority of these require 
validation before clinical translation is possible. In this two-part review, we 
discuss the systematic collaboration across structural, anatomical, and 
molecular imaging techniques that constitute MFI. Part I reviews positron 
emission tomography, radiogenomics, AI, and optical imaging, while part II 
reviews MRI, CT and ultrasound, their current status, and recent advances in the 
field of precision oncology.

With the advancement of high-throughput biotechnologies, we increasingly 
accumulate biomedical data about diseases, especially cancer. There is a need 
for computational models and methods to sift through, integrate, and extract new 
knowledge from the diverse available data, to improve the mechanistic 
understanding of diseases and patient care. To uncover molecular mechanisms and 
drug indications for specific cancer types, we develop an integrative framework 
able to harness a wide range of diverse molecular and pan-cancer data. We show 
that our approach outperforms the competing methods and can identify new 
associations. Furthermore, it captures the underlying biology predictive of drug 
response. Through the joint integration of data sources, our framework can also 
uncover links between cancer types and molecular entities for which no prior 
knowledge is available. Our new framework is flexible and can be easily 
reformulated to study any biomedical problem.

The present era of precision medicine sees "cancer" as a consequence of 
molecular derangements occurring at the commencement of the disease process, 
with morphological changes happening much later in the process of 
tumourigenesis. Conventional imaging techniques, such as computed tomography 
(CT), ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play an integral role 
in the detection of disease at the macroscopic level. However, molecular 
functional imaging (MFI) techniques entail the visualisation and quantification 
of biochemical and physiological processes occurring during tumourigenesis. MFI 
has the potential to play a key role in heralding the transition from the 
concept of "one-size-fits-all" treatment to "precision medicine". Integration of 
MFI with other fields of tumour biology such as genomics has spawned a novel

The lensless on-chip microscope is an emerging technology in the recent decade 
that can realize the imaging and analysis of biological samples with a wide 
field-of-view without huge optical devices and any lenses. Because of its small 
size, low cost, and being easy to hold and operate, it can be used as an 
alternative tool for large microscopes in resource-poor or remote areas, which 
is of great significance for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 
diseases. To improve the low-resolution characteristics of the existing lensless 
shadow imaging systems and to meet the high-resolution needs of point-of-care 
testing, here, we propose a high-precision on-chip microscope based on in-line 
holographic technology. We demonstrated the ability of the iterative phase 
recovery algorithm to recover sample information and evaluated it with image 
quality evaluation algorithms with or without reference. The results showed that 
the resolution of the holographic image after iterative phase recovery is 1.41 
times that of traditional shadow imaging. Moreover, we used machine learning 
tools to identify and count the mixed samples of mouse ascites tumor cells and 
micro-particles that were iterative phase recovered. The results showed that the 
on-chip cell counter had high-precision counting characteristics as compared 
with manual counting of the microscope reference image. Therefore, the proposed 
high-precision lensless microscope on a chip based on in-line holographic 
imaging provides one promising solution for future point-of-care testing (POCT).

BACKGROUND: Reidentification of prior nodules for temporal comparison is an 
important but time-consuming step in lung cancer screening. We develop and 
evaluate an automated nodule detector that utilizes the axial-slice number of 
nodules found in radiology reports to generate high precision nodule 
predictions.
METHODS: 888 CTs from Lung Nodule Analysis were used to train a 2-dimensional 
(2D) object detection neural network. A pipeline of 2D object detection, 3D 
unsupervised clustering, false positive reduction, and axial-slice numbers were 
used to generate nodule candidates. 47 CTs from the National Lung Cancer 
Screening Trial (NLST) were used for model evaluation.
RESULTS: Our nodule detector achieved a precision of 0.962 at a recall of 0.573 
on the NLST test set for any nodule. When adjusting for unintended nodule 
predictions, we achieved a precision of 0.931 at a recall 0.561, which 
corresponds to 0.06 false positives per CT. Error analysis revealed better 
detection of nodules with soft tissue attenuation compared to ground glass and 
undeterminable attenuation. Nodule margins, size, location, and patient 
demographics did not differ between correct and incorrect predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of axial-slice numbers from radiology reports allowed 
for development of a lung nodule detector with a low false positive rate 
compared to prior feature-engineering and machine learning approaches. This high 
precision nodule detector can reduce time spent on reidentification of prior 
nodules during lung cancer screening and can rapidly develop new institutional 
datasets to explore novel applications of computer vision in lung cancer 
imaging.

PRIMAGE is one of the largest and more ambitious research projects dealing with 
medical imaging, artificial intelligence and cancer treatment in children. It is 
a 4-year European Commission-financed project that has 16 European partners in 
the consortium, including the European Society for Paediatric Oncology, two 
imaging biobanks, and three prominent European paediatric oncology units. The 
project is constructed as an observational in silico study involving 
high-quality anonymised datasets (imaging, clinical, molecular, and genetics) 
for the training and validation of machine learning and multiscale algorithms. 
The open cloud-based platform will offer precise clinical assistance for 
phenotyping (diagnosis), treatment allocation (prediction), and patient 
endpoints (prognosis), based on the use of imaging biomarkers, tumour growth 
simulation, advanced visualisation of confidence scores, and machine-learning 
approaches. The decision support prototype will be constructed and validated on 
two paediatric cancers: neuroblastoma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. 
External validation will be performed on data recruited from independent 
collaborative centres. Final results will be available for the scientific 
community at the end of the project, and ready for translation to other 
malignant solid tumours.

BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform our 
healthcare systems significantly. New AI technologies based on machine learning 
approaches should play a key role in clinical decision-making in the future. 
However, their implementation in health care settings remains limited, mostly 
due to a lack of robust validation procedures. There is a need to develop 
reliable assessment frameworks for the clinical validation of AI. We present 
here an approach for assessing AI for predicting treatment response in 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), using real-world data and molecular -omics 
data from clinical data warehouses and biobanks.
METHODS: The European "ITFoC (Information Technology for the Future Of Cancer)" 
consortium designed a framework for the clinical validation of AI technologies 
for predicting treatment response in oncology.
RESULTS: This framework is based on seven key steps specifying: (1) the intended 
use of AI, (2) the target population, (3) the timing of AI evaluation, (4) the 
datasets used for evaluation, (5) the procedures used for ensuring data safety 
(including data quality, privacy and security), (6) the metrics used for 
measuring performance, and (7) the procedures used to ensure that the AI is 
explainable. This framework forms the basis of a validation platform that we are 
building for the "ITFoC Challenge". This community-wide competition will make it 
possible to assess and compare AI algorithms for predicting the response to TNBC 
treatments with external real-world datasets.
CONCLUSIONS: The predictive performance and safety of AI technologies must be 
assessed in a robust, unbiased and transparent manner before their 
implementation in healthcare settings. We believe that the consideration of the 
ITFoC consortium will contribute to the safe transfer and implementation of AI 
in clinical settings, in the context of precision oncology and personalized 
care.

With the convergence of digital pathology (DP) and artificial intelligence (AI), 
anatomic pathology practice has been experiencing an exciting paradigm shifting. 
Pathologists will be provided with an augmented ability to improve diagnostic 
accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. There will be subvisual morphometric 
features discovered and multiomics data integrated to provide better prognostic 
and theragnostic information to guide individual patients' management. The 
perspective for future precision medicine is promising. However, there are many 
challenges before AI-assisted DP diagnostic workflows can be successfully 
implemented. Herein, we briefly review some examples of AI application in 
anatomic pathology with an emphasis on the subspecialty of gastrointestinal 
pathology and discuss potential challenges for clinical implementation.

Leonard Bickman's (2020) Festschrift paper in the special issue "The Future of 
Children's Mental Health Services" on improving mental health services is an 
impressive reflection of his career, highlighting his major insights and the 
development of mental health services research as a whole. Five major 
difficulties in this field's current research and practice are attentively 
delineated: poor diagnostics, measurement problems, disadvantages of randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs), lack of feedback and personalized treatments. Dr. 
Bickman recommends possible solutions based on his extensive experience and 
empirical findings. We agree with his thoughts and illustrate how we, challenged 
with the same problems, have attempted to develop clinically informed research 
and evidence-based clinical practice. A comprehensive feedback system that deals 
with the aforementioned problems is briefly described. It includes pre-treatment 
recommendations for treatment strategies and an empirically informed dropout 
prediction based on a variety of data sources. In addition to treatment 
recommendations, continuous feedback as well as individualized treatment 
adaptation tools are provided during ongoing therapy. New projects are being 
implemented to further improve the system by including new data assessment 
strategies and sources, e.g., ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and 
automated video analysis.

OBJECTIVE: To apply a precision medicine approach to determine the optimal 
treatment regime for participants in an exercise (E), dietary weight loss (D), 
and D + E trial for knee osteoarthritis that would maximize their expected 
outcomes.
METHODS: Using data from 343 participants of the Intensive Diet and Exercise for 
Arthritis (IDEA) trial, we applied 24 machine-learning models to develop 
individualized treatment rules on 7 outcomes: Short Form 36 physical component 
score, weight loss, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis 
Index (WOMAC) pain/function/stiffness scores, compressive force, and 
interleukin-6 level. The optimal model was selected based on jackknife value 
function estimates that indicate improvement in the outcomes if future 
participants follow the estimated decision rule compared to the optimal single, 
fixed treatment model.
RESULTS: Multiple outcome random forest was the optimal model for the WOMAC 
outcomes. For the other outcomes, list-based models were optimal. For example, 
the estimated optimal decision rule for weight loss indicated assigning the D + 
E intervention to participants with baseline weight not exceeding 109.35 kg and 
waist circumference above 90.25 cm, and assigning D to all other participants 
except those with a history of a heart attack. If applied to future 
participants, the optimal rule for weight loss is estimated to increase average 
weight loss to 11.2 kg at 18 months, contrasted with 9.8 kg if all participants 
received D + E (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The precision medicine models supported the overall findings from 
IDEA that the D + E intervention was optimal for most participants, but there 
was evidence that a subgroup of participants would likely benefit more from diet 
alone for 2 outcomes.

Cancers exhibit functional and structural diversity in distinct patients. In 
this mass, normal and malignant cells create tumor microenvironment that is 
heterogeneous among patients. A residue from primary tumors leaks into the 
bloodstream as cell clusters and single cells, providing clues about disease 
progression and therapeutic response. The complexity of these hierarchical 
microenvironments needs to be elucidated. Although tumors comprise ample cell 
types, the standard clinical technique is still the histology that is limited to 
a single marker. Multiplexed imaging technologies open new directions in 
pathology. Spatially resolved proteomic, genomic, and metabolic profiles of 
human cancers are now possible at the single-cell level. This perspective 
discusses spatial bioimaging methods to decipher the cascade of 
microenvironments in solid and liquid biopsies. A unique synthesis of top-down 
and bottom-up analysis methods is presented. Spatial multi-omics profiles can be 
tailored to precision oncology through artificial intelligence. Data-driven 
patient profiling enables personalized medicine and beyond.

Paediatric disorders of impaired linear growth are challenging to manage, in 
part because of delays in the identification of pathological short stature and 
subsequent referral and diagnosis, the requirement for long-term therapy, and 
frequent poor adherence to treatment, notably with human growth hormone (hGH). 
Digital health technologies hold promise for improving outcomes in paediatric 
growth disorders by supporting personalisation of care, from diagnosis to 
treatment and follow up. The value of automated systems in monitoring linear 
growth in children has been demonstrated in Finland, with findings that such a 
system is more effective than a traditional manual system for early diagnosis of 
abnormal growth. Artificial intelligence has potential to resolve problems of 
variability that may occur during analysis of growth information, and augmented 
reality systems have been developed that aim to educate patients and caregivers 
about growth disorders and their treatment (such as injection techniques for hGH 
administration). Adherence to hGH treatment is often suboptimal, which 
negatively impacts the achievement of physical and psychological benefits of the 
treatment. Personalisation of adherence support necessitates capturing 
individual patient adherence data; the use of technology to assist with this is 
exemplified by the use of an electronic injection device, which shares real-time 
recordings of the timing, date and dose of hGH delivered to the patient with the 
clinician, via web-based software. The use of an electronic device is associated 
with high levels of adherence to hGH treatment and improved growth outcomes. It 
can be anticipated that future technological advances, coupled with continued 
'human interventions' from healthcare providers, will further improve management 
of paediatric growth disorders.

"Precision medicine" has revolutionized how we respond to diseases by using an 
individual's genomic data and lifestyle and environment-related information to 
create an effective personalized treatment. However, issues surrounding 
regulations, medical insurance payments and the use of patients' medical data, 
have delayed the development of precision medicine and made it difficult to 
achieve "true" personalization. We therefore recommend that precision medicine 
be transformed into precision health: a novel and generalized platform of tools 
and methods that could prevent, manage, and treat disease at a population level. 
"Precision health," one of six core strategic industries highlighted in Taiwan's 
vision for 2030, uses various physiological data, genomic data, and external 
factors, to develop unique "preventative" solutions or therapeutic strategies. 
For Taiwan to implement precision health, it has to address three challenges: 
(1) the high-cost issue of precision health; (2) the harmonization issues 
surrounding integration and transmission of specimen and data; (3) the legal 
issue of combining information and communications technology (ICT) with 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) for medical use. In this paper, we propose an 
innovative framework with six recommendations for facilitating the development 
of precision health in Taiwan, including a novel model of precise telemedicine 
with AI-aided technology. We then describe how these tools can be proactively 
applied in early response to the COVID-19 crisis. We believe that precision 
health represents an important shift to more proactive and preventive healthcare 
that enables people to lead healthier lives.

OBJECTIVES: Endodontic treatment works as a successful treatment modality in 
several cases. However, it may fail due to some reasons unforeseeable by the 
dentist. Many failures can be prevented by carefully assessing the difficulty 
level of the case before initiating treatment or by referral to a specialist. 
This study presents an approach using machine learning to generate an algorithm 
which can help predict the difficulty level of the case and decide about a 
referral, with the help of the standard American Association of Endodontists 
(AAE) Endodontic Case Difficulty Assessment Form.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the AAE Endodontic Case Difficulty Form after 
obtaining the patients' consent, 500 potential root canal patients were 
diagnosed. The filled forms were assessed by two pre-calibrated endodontists, 
and, in cases of conflicting opinion, a third endodontist's opinion was taken. 
Artificial neural network was used for generating the algorithm.
RESULTS: Using 500 filled AAE forms, a sensitivity of 94.96% was achieved by the 
machine learning algorithm.
CONCLUSION: This study provides an option for automation to the conventional 
method of predicting the difficulty level of a case, thus increasing the speed 
of decision-making and referrals if necessary.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: An AAE Endodontic Case Difficulty Assessment Form when 
utilized along with machine learning can assist general dentists in rapid 
assessment of the case difficulty. This is a helpful tool in developing 
countries, where endodontic treatment and referral guidelines are often 
neglected. It also helps to make difficulty level assessments easier for novice 
practitioners, when they are in doubt about the same.

Today Artificial Intelligence (AI) supports difficult decisions about policy, 
health, and our personal lives. The AI algorithms we develop and deploy to make 
sense of information, are informed by data, and based on models that capture and 
use pertinent details of the population or phenomenon being analyzed. For any 
application area, more importantly in precision medicine which directly impacts 
human lives, the data upon which algorithms are run must be procured, cleaned, 
and organized well to assure reliable and interpretable results, and to assure 
that they do not perpetrate or amplify human prejudices. This must be done 
without violating basic assumptions of the algorithms in use. Algorithmic 
results need to be clearly communicated to stakeholders and domain experts to 
enable sound conclusions. Our position is that AI holds great promise for 
supporting precision medicine, but we need to move forward with great care, with 
consideration for possible ethical implications. We make the case that a 
no-boundary or convergent approach is essential to support sound and ethical 
decisions. No-boundary thinking supports problem definition and solving with 
teams of experts possessing diverse perspectives. When dealing with AI and the 
data needed to use AI, there is a spectrum of activities that needs the 
attention of a no-boundary team. This is necessary if we are to draw viable 
conclusions and develop actions and policies based on the AI, the data, and the 
scientific foundations of the domain in question.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common form of malignant primary brain tumor with 
a dismal prognosis. Currently, the standard treatments for GBM rarely achieve 
satisfactory results, which means that current treatments are not individualized 
and precise enough. In this study, a multiomics-based GBM classification was 
established and three subclasses (GPA, GPB, and GPC) were identified, which have 
different molecular features both in bulk samples and at single-cell resolution. 
A robust GBM poor prognostic signature (GPS) score model was then developed 
using machine learning method, manifesting an excellent ability to predict the 
survival of GBM. NVP-BEZ235, GDC-0980, dasatinib and XL765 were ultimately 
identified to have subclass-specific efficacy targeting patients with a high 
risk of poor prognosis. Furthermore, the GBM classification and GPS score model 
could be considered as potential biomarkers for immunotherapy response. In 
summary, an integrative genomic analysis was conducted to advance 
individual-based therapies in GBM.

Heterogeneity is recognized as a major barrier in efforts to improve the care 
and outcomes of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Even within the 
narrower stratum of moderate and severe TBI, current management approaches do 
not capture the complexity of this condition characterized by manifold clinical, 
anatomical, and pathophysiologic features. One approach to heterogeneity may be 
to resolve undifferentiated TBI populations into endotypes, subclasses that are 
distinguished by shared biological characteristics. The endotype paradigm has 
been explored in a range of medical domains, including psychiatry, oncology, 
immunology, and pulmonology. In intensive care, endotypes are being investigated 
for syndromes such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This 
review provides an overview of the endotype paradigm as well as some of its 
methods and use cases. A conceptual framework is proposed for endotype research 
in moderate and severe TBI, together with a scientific road map for endotype 
discovery and validation in this population.

BACKGROUND: Cancer cell lines are frequently used in research as in-vitro tumor 
models. Genomic data and large-scale drug screening have accelerated the right 
drug selection for cancer patients. Accuracy in drug response prediction is 
crucial for success. Due to data-type diversity and big data volume, few methods 
can integrative and efficiently find the principal low-dimensional manifold of 
the high-dimensional cancer multi-omics data to predict drug response in 
precision medicine.
METHOD: A novelty k-means Ensemble Support Vector Regression (kESVR) is 
developed to predict each drug response values for single patient based on 
cell-line gene expression data. The kESVR is a blend of supervised and 
unsupervised learning methods and is entirely data driven. It utilizes embedded 
clustering (Principal Component Analysis and k-means clustering) and local 
regression (Support Vector Regression) to predict drug response and obtain the 
global pattern while overcoming missing data and outliers' noise.
RESULTS: We compared the efficiency and accuracy of kESVR to 4 standard machine 
learning regression models: (1) simple linear regression, (2) support vector 
regression (3) random forest (quantile regression forest) and (4) back 
propagation neural network. Our results, which based on drug response across 610 
cancer cells from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Cancer Therapeutics 
Response Portal (CTRP v2), proved to have the highest accuracy (smallest mean 
squared error (MSE) measure). We next compared kESVR with existing 17 drug 
response prediction models based a varied range of methods such as regression, 
Bayesian inference, matrix factorization and deep learning. After ranking the 18 
models based on their accuracy of prediction, kESVR ranks first (best 
performing) in majority (74%) of the time. As for the remaining (26%) cases, 
kESVR still ranked in the top five performing models.
CONCLUSION: In this paper we introduce a novel model (kESVR) for drug response 
prediction using high dimensional cell-line gene expression data. This model 
outperforms current existing prediction models in terms of prediction accuracy 
and speed and overcomes overfitting. This can be used in future to develop a 
robust drug response prediction system for cancer patients using the cancer 
cell-lines guidance and multi-omics data.

Precision Nutrition (PN) is an approach to developing comprehensive and dynamic 
nutritional recommendations based on individual variables, including genetics, 
microbiome, metabolic profile, health status, physical activity, dietary 
pattern, food environment as well as socioeconomic and psychosocial 
characteristics. PN can help answer the question "What should I eat to be 
healthy?", recognizing that what is healthful for one individual may not be the 
same for another, and understanding that health and responses to diet change 
over time. The growth of the PN market has been driven by increasing consumer 
interest in individualized products and services coupled with advances in 
technology, analytics, and omic sciences. However, important concerns are 
evident regarding the adequacy of scientific substantiation supporting claims 
for current products and services. An additional limitation to accessing PN is 
the current cost of diagnostic tests and wearable devices. Despite these 
challenges, PN holds great promise as a tool to improve healthspan and reduce 
healthcare costs. Accelerating advancement in PN will require: (a) investment in 
multidisciplinary collaborations to enable the development of user-friendly 
tools applying technological advances in omics, sensors, artificial 
intelligence, big data management, and analytics; (b) engagement of healthcare 
professionals and payers to support equitable and broader adoption of PN as 
medicine shifts toward preventive and personalized approaches; and (c) 
system-wide collaboration between stakeholders to advocate for continued support 
for evidence-based PN, develop a regulatory framework to maintain consumer trust 
and engagement, and allow PN to reach its full potential.

personalised medicine using electronic health records and machine learning 
classifiers.

BACKGROUND: The bacteraemia prediction is relevant because sepsis is one of the 
most important causes of morbidity and mortality. Bacteraemia prognosis 
primarily depends on a rapid diagnosis. The bacteraemia prediction would shorten 
up to 6 days the diagnosis, and, in conjunction with individual patient 
variables, should be considered to start the early administration of 
personalised antibiotic treatment and medical services, the election of specific 
diagnostic techniques and the determination of additional treatments, such as 
surgery, that would prevent subsequent complications. Machine learning 
techniques could help physicians make these informed decisions by predicting 
bacteraemia using the data already available in electronic hospital records.
OBJECTIVE: This study presents the application of machine learning techniques to 
these records to predict the blood culture's outcome, which would reduce the lag 
in starting a personalised antibiotic treatment and the medical costs associated 
with erroneous treatments due to conservative assumptions about blood culture 
outcomes.
METHODS: Six supervised classifiers were created using three machine learning 
techniques, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbours, on 
the electronic health records of hospital patients. The best approach to handle 
missing data was chosen and, for each machine learning technique, two 
classification models were created: the first uses the features known at the 
time of blood extraction, whereas the second uses four extra features revealed 
during the blood culture.
RESULTS: The six classifiers were trained and tested using a dataset of 4357 
patients with 117 features per patient. The models obtain predictions that, for 
the best case, are up to a state-of-the-art accuracy of 85.9%, a sensitivity of 
87.4% and an AUC of 0.93.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide cutting-edge metrics of interest in predictive 
medical models with values that exceed the medical practice threshold and 
previous results in the literature using classical modelling techniques in 
specific types of bacteraemia. Additionally, the consistency of results is 
reasserted because the three classifiers' importance ranking shows similar 
features that coincide with those that physicians use in their manual 
heuristics. Therefore, the efficacy of these machine learning techniques 
confirms their viability to assist in the aims of predictive and personalised 
medicine once the disease presents bacteraemia-compatible symptoms and to assist 
in improving the healthcare economy.

Many diseases that affect modern humans fall in the category of complex 
diseases, thus called because they result from a combination of multiple 
aetiological and pathogenic factors. Regardless of the organ or system affected, 
complex diseases present major challenges in diagnosis, classification, and 
management. Current forms of therapy are usually applied in an indiscriminate 
fashion based on clinical information, but even the most advanced drugs only 
benefit a limited number of patients and to a variable and unpredictable degree. 
This 'one measure does not fit all' situation has spurred the notion that 
therapy for complex disease should be tailored to individual patients or groups 
of patients, giving rise to the notion of 'precision medicine' [PM]. 
Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is a prototypical complex disease where the 
need for PM has become increasingly clear. This prompted the European Crohn's 
and Colitis Organisation to focus the Seventh Scientific Workshop on this 
emerging theme. The articles in this special issue of the Journal address the 
various complementary aspects of PM in IBD, including what PM is; why it is 
needed and how it can be used; how PM can contribute to prediction and 
prevention of IBD; how IBD PM can aid in prognosis and improve response to 
therapy; and the challenges and future directions of PM in IBD. This first 
article of this series is structured on three simple concepts [what, why, and 
how] and addresses the definition of PM, discusses the rationale for the need of 
PM in IBD, and outlines the methodology required to implement PM in IBD in a 
correct and clinically meaningful way.

Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are short (∼21 nt) non-coding RNAs that regulate gene 
expression through the degradation or translational repression of mRNAs. 
Accumulating evidence points to a role of miRNA regulation in the pathogenesis 
of a wide range of neurodegenerative (ND) diseases such as, for example, 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 
Huntington disease (HD). Several systems level studies aimed to explore the role 
of miRNA regulation in NDs, but these studies remain challenging. Part of the 
problem may be related to the lack of sufficiently rich or homogeneous data, 
such as time series or cell-type-specific data obtained in model systems or 
human biosamples, to account for context dependency. Part of the problem may 
also be related to the methodological challenges associated with the accurate 
system-level modeling of miRNA and mRNA data. Here, we critically review the 
main families of machine learning methods used to analyze expression data, 
highlighting the added value of using shape-analysis concepts as a solution for 
precisely modeling highly dimensional miRNA and mRNA data such as the ones 
obtained in the study of the HD process, and elaborating on the potential of 
these concepts and methods for modeling complex omics data.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of machine learning (ML) for the management 
of Medicare beneficiaries at risk of severe respiratory infections in community 
and postacute settings by (1) identifying individuals in a community setting at 
risk of infections resulting in emergent hospitalization and (2) matching 
individuals in a postacute setting to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) that are 
likely to reduce the risk of infections.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of claims from 2 million Medicare 
beneficiaries for 2017-2019.
METHODS: In the first analysis, the rate of emergent hospitalization due to 
respiratory infections was measured among beneficiaries predicted by ML to be at 
highest risk and compared with the overall average for the population. In the 
second analysis, the rate of emergent hospitalization due to respiratory 
infections was compared between beneficiaries who went to an SNF with lower 
predicted risk of infections using ML and beneficiaries who did not.
RESULTS: In the community setting, beneficiaries predicted to be at highest risk 
had significantly increased rates of emergency department visits (13-fold) and 
hospitalizations (18-fold) due to respiratory infections. In the postacute 
setting, beneficiaries who received care at top-recommended SNFs had a relative 
reduction of 37% for emergent care and 36% for inpatient hospitalization due to 
respiratory infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Precision management through personalized and predictive ML offers 
the opportunity to reduce the burden of outbreaks of respiratory infections. In 
the community setting, ML can identify vulnerable subpopulations at highest risk 
of severe infections. In postacute settings, ML can inform patient choices by 
matching beneficiaries to SNFs likely to reduce future risk.

Bladder cancer (BC) is the 10th most common cancer worldwide. Approximately one 
quarter of patients with BC have muscle-invasive disease (MIBC). Muscle-invasive 
disease carries a poor prognosis and choosing the optimal treatment option is 
critical to improve patients' outcomes. Ongoing research supports the role of 
2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) in 
guiding patient-specific management decisions throughout the course of MIBC. As 
an imaging modality, 18F-FDG PET is acquired simultaneously with either computed 
tomography (CT) or MRI to offer a hybrid approach combining anatomical and 
metabolic information that complement each other. At initial staging, 18F-FDG 
PET/CT enhances the detection of extravesical disease, particularly in patients 
classified as oligometastatic by conventional imaging. 18F-FDG PET/CT has value 
in monitoring response to neoadjuvant and systemic chemotherapy, as well as in 
localizing relapse after treatment. In the new era of immunotherapy, 18F-FDG 
PET/CT may also be useful to monitor treatment efficacy as well as to detect 
immune-related adverse events. With the advent of artificial intelligence 
techniques such as radiomics and deep learning, these hybrid medical images can 
be mined for quantitative data, providing incremental value over current 
standard-of-care clinical and biological data. This approach has the potential 
to produce a major paradigm shift toward data-driven precision medicine with the 
ultimate goal of personalized medicine. In this review, we highlight current 
literature reporting the role of 18F-FDG PET in supporting personalized 
management decisions for patients with MIBC. Specific topics reviewed include

The field of infectious diseases currently takes a reactive approach and treats 
infections as they present in patients. Although certain populations are known 
to be at greater risk of developing infection (eg, immunocompromised), we lack a 
systems approach to define the true risk of future infection for a patient. 
Guided by impressive gains in "omics" technologies, future strategies to 
infectious diseases should take a precision approach to infection through 
identification of patients at intermediate and high-risk of infection and deploy 
targeted preventative measures (ie, prophylaxis). The advances of 
high-throughput immune profiling by multiomics approaches (ie, transcriptomics, 
epigenomics, metabolomics, proteomics) hold the promise to identify patients at 
increased risk of infection and enable risk-stratifying approaches to be applied 
in the clinic. Integration of patient-specific data using machine learning 
improves the effectiveness of prediction, providing the necessary technologies 
needed to propel the field of infectious diseases medicine into the era of 
personalized medicine.

Gaining insight into the mechanisms of signal transduction networks (STNs) by 
using critical features from patient-specific mathematical models can improve 
patient stratification and help to identify potential drug targets. To achieve 
this, these models should focus on the critical STNs for each cancer, include 
prognostic genes and proteins, and correctly predict patient-specific 
differences in STN activity. Focussing on colorectal cancer and the WNT STN, we 
used mechanism-based machine learning models to identify genes and proteins with 
significant associations to event-free patient survival and predictive power for 
explaining patient-specific differences of STN activity. First, we identified 
the WNT pathway as the most significant pathway associated with event-free 
survival. Second, we built linear-regression models that incorporated both genes 
and proteins from established mechanistic models in the literature and novel 
genes with significant associations to event-free patient survival. Data from 
The Cancer Genome Atlas and Clinical Proteomic Tumour Analysis Consortium were 
used, and patient-specific STN activity scores were computed using PROGENy. 
Three linear regression models were built, based on; (1) the gene-set of a 
state-of-the-art mechanistic model in the literature, (2) novel genes 
identified, and (3) novel proteins identified. The novel genes and proteins were 
genes and proteins of the extant WNT pathway whose expression was significantly 
associated with event-free survival. The results show that the predictive power 
of a model that incorporated novel event-free associated genes is better 
compared to a model focussing on the genes of a current state-of-the-art 
mechanistic model. Several significant genes that should be integrated into 
future mechanistic models of the WNT pathway are DVL3, FZD5, RAC1, ROCK2, GSK3B, 
CTB2, CBT1, and PRKCA. Thus, the study demonstrates that using mechanistic 
information in combination with machine learning can identify novel features 
(genes and proteins) that are important for explaining the STN heterogeneity 
between patients and their association to clinical outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: The digitization of dentistry has brought many opportunities to 
the specialty of orthodontics. Advances in computing power and artificial 
intelligence are set to significantly impact the specialty. In this article, the 
accuracy of automated facial analysis for vertical dimensions using machine 
learning is evaluated.
METHODS: Automated facial analysis of 45 patients (20 female, 25 male) was 
conducted. The subjects' ages were between 15 and 25 years (mean, 18.7; standard 
deviation, 3.2). A python program was written by the authors to detect the 
faces, annotate them and compute vertical dimensions. The accuracy of the manual 
annotation of digital images was compared with the proposed model. Intrarater 
and interrater reliability were evaluated for the manual method, whereas 
intraclass correlation and the Bland-Altman analysis were compared with manual 
and automated methods.
RESULTS: The authors found acceptable intrarater reliability and moderate to 
poor interrater reliability for the manual method. The agreement was found 
between manual and automated methods of facial analysis. The 95% confidence 
interval limit of agreements was <10% for the metrics assessing vertical 
dimension.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning offers the ability to conduct reliable and easily 
reproducible analyses on large datasets of images. This new tool presents 
opportunities for further advances in research and clinical orthodontics.

The release of the 2020-2030 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research (SPNR) 
and its emphasis on precision nutrition has provided an opportunity to identify 
future nutrition research that addresses individual variability in response to 
diet and nutrition across the life span-including those relevant to the 
Strategic Vision of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). The 
SPNR and the NHLBI's Strategic Vision were developed with extensive input from 
the extramural research community, and both have 4 overarching strategic goals 
within which are embedded several objectives for research. For the SPNR, these 
include 1) spur discovery science and normal biological functions (e.g., role of 
the microbiome in health and disease), 2) population science to understand 
individual differences (e.g., biomarkers including 'omics that predict disease 
status), 3) emerging scientific areas of investigation and their application 
(e.g., data science, artificial intelligence), and 4) cross-cutting themes 
(e.g., training the scientific workforce and minority health and health 
disparities). These strategic goals and objectives serve as blueprints for 
research and training. Nutrition remains important in the prevention and 
treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders and diseases, and 
the NHLBI has played a pivotal role in supporting nutrition research. In this 
paper, we report important gaps in the scientific literature related to 
precision nutrition in HLBS diseases. Research opportunities that could 
stimulate precision nutrition and their alignment with the SPNR and the NHLBI 
Strategic Vision Objectives are provided. These opportunities include 1) 
exploring individual differences in response to varying dietary patterns and 
nutrients; 2) investigating genetic/epigenetic, biological (e.g., microbiome, 
biomarkers), social, psychosocial, and environmental underpinnings of individual 
variability in diet; 3) elucidating the role of circadian rhythm and 
chrononutrition; and 4) applying implementation science research methods in 
precision nutrition interventions relevant to HLBS diseases.

In the age of high-throughput, single-cell biology, single-cell imaging has 
evolved not only in terms of technological advancements but also in its 
translational applications. The synchronous advancements of imaging and 
computational biology have produced opportunities of merging the two, providing 
the scientific community with tools towards observing, understanding, and 
predicting cellular and tissue phenotypes and behaviors. Furthermore, 
multiplexed single-cell imaging and machine learning algorithms now enable 
patient stratification and predictive diagnostics of clinical specimens. Here, 
we provide an overall summary of the advances in single-cell imaging, with a 
focus on high-throughput microscopy phenomics and multiplexed proteomic spatial 
imaging platforms. We also review various computational tools that have been 
developed in recent years for image processing and downstream applications used 
in biomedical sciences. Finally, we discuss how harnessing systems biology 
approaches and data integration across disciplines can further strengthen the 
exciting applications and future implementation of single-cell imaging on 
precision medicine.

Biobanking is entering the new era-era of big data. New technologies, 
techniques, and knowledge opened the potential of the whole domain of 
biobanking. Biobanks collect, analyse, store, and share the samples and 
associated data. Both samples and especially associated data are growing 
enormously, and new innovative approaches are required to handle samples and to 
utilize the potential of biobanking data. The data reached the quantity and 
quality of big data, and the scientists are facing the questions how to use them 
more efficiently, both retrospectively and prospectively with the aim to 
discover new preventive methods, optimize treatment, and follow up and to 
optimize healthcare processes. Biobanking in the era of big data contribute to 
the development of predictive, preventive, and personalised medicine, for every 
patient providing the right treatment at the right time. Biobanking in the era 
of big data contributes to the paradigm shift towards personalising of 
healthcare.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: This opinion paper expanded on the WHO "six-step 
approach to optimal pharmacotherapy," by detailed exploration of the underlying 
pharmacological and pathophysiological principles. This exercise led to the 
identification of a large number of domains of research that should be addressed 
to make clinical pharmacology progress toward "precision clinical pharmacology," 
as a prerequisite for precision medicine.
RESULT: In order to improve clinical efficacy and safety in patient groups (to 
guide drug development) as well as in individuals (to guide therapeutic options 
and optimize clinical outcome), developments in clinical pharmacology should at 
least tackle the following: (1) molecular diagnostic assays to guide drug design 
and development and allow physicians to identify the optimal targets for therapy 
in the individual patient in a quick and precise manner (to guide selection of 
the right drug for the right patient); (2) the setting up and validation of 
biomarkers of target engagement and modification as predictors of clinical 
efficacy and safety; (3) integration of physiological PK/PD models and 
intermediate markers of pharmacological effects with the natural evolution of 
the disease to predict the drug dose that most effectively improves clinical 
outcome in patient groups and individuals, making use of advanced 
modeling technologies (building on deterministic models, machine-learning, and 
deep learning algorithms); (4) methodology to validate human or humanized in 
vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models for their ability to predict clinical outcome 
with investigational therapies, including nucleic acids or recombinant genes 
together with vectors (including viruses or nanoparticles), cell therapy, or 
therapeutic vaccines; (5) methodological complements to the gold-standard, large 
Phase 3 randomized clinical trial to provide clinically relevant and reliable 
data on the efficacy and safety of all treatment options at the population level 
(pragmatic clinical trials), as well as in small groups of patients (as low as n 
= 1); (6) regulatory science, so as to optimize the ethical review process, 
documentation, and monitoring of clinical trials, improve efficiency, and reduce 
costs of clinical drug development; (7) interventions to effectively improve 
patient compliance and to rationalize polypharmacy for the reduction of adverse 
effects and the enhancement of therapeutic interactions; and (8) appraisal of 
the ecological and societal impact of drug use to safeguard against 
environmental hazards (following the "One Health" concept) and to reduce drug 
resistance.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: As can be seen, precision clinical pharmacology aims 
at being highly translational, which will require very large panels of 
complementary skills. Interdisciplinary collaborations, including non-clinical 
pharmacologists, will be key to achieve such an ambitious program.

Protein glycation provides a biomarker in widespread clinical use, glycated 
hemoglobin HbA1c (A1C). It is a biomarker for diagnosis of diabetes and 
prediabetes and of medium-term glycemic control in patients with established 
diabetes. A1C is an early-stage glycation adduct of hemoglobin with glucose; a 
fructosamine derivative. Glucose is an amino group-directed glycating agent, 
modifying N-terminal and lysine sidechain amino groups. A similar fructosamine 
derivative of serum albumin, glycated albumin (GA), finds use as a biomarker of 
glycemic control, particularly where there is interference in use of A1C. Later 
stage adducts, advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), are formed by the 
degradation of fructosamines and by the reaction of reactive dicarbonyl 
metabolites, such as methylglyoxal. Dicarbonyls are arginine-directed glycating 
agents forming mainly hydroimidazolone AGEs. Glucosepane and pentosidine, an 
intense fluorophore, are AGE covalent crosslinks. Cellular proteolysis of 
glycated proteins forms glycated amino acids, which are released into plasma and 
excreted in urine. Development of diagnostic algorithms by artificial 
intelligence machine learning is enhancing the applications of glycation 
biomarkers. Investigational glycation biomarkers are in development for: (i) 
healthy aging; (ii) risk prediction of vascular complications of diabetes; (iii) 
diagnosis of autism; and (iv) diagnosis and classification of early-stage 
arthritis. Protein glycation biomarkers are influenced by heritability, aging, 
decline in metabolic, vascular, renal and skeletal health, and other factors. 
They are applicable to populations of differing ethnicities, bridging the gap 
between genotype and phenotype. They are thereby likely to find continued and 
expanding clinical use, including in the current era of developing precision 
medicine, reporting on multiple pathogenic processes and supporting a precision 
medicine approach.

The anti-cancer targets play a crucial role in the signaling processes of cells, 
and therefore, it becomes nearly impossible to engage these targets without 
affecting the native cellular function. Thus, an approach has been taken to 
develop an anti-cancer Scanner (ACPS) tool aimed toward the recognition of 
anti-cancer marks in the form of peptides. The proposed ACPS tool allows fast 
fingerprinting of the anti-cancer targets having extreme significance in the 
current bioinformatics research. There already exist some tools that offer these 
features on a single platform; however, the performance of ACPS was compared 
with the preexisting online tools and was observed that ACPS offers greater than 
95% accuracy that is comparatively much higher. The anti-cancer marked sequences 
of proteins supplied by the operators are scanned against the anti-cancer target 
datasets via ACPS and provide precision-based anti-cancer peptides. The proposed 
tool has been contrived in PERL programming language, and this tool is the 
extended version of A-CaMP codes, which are highly scalable having an extensible 
application in cancer biology with robust coding architecture. The availability 
of tools like ACPS will greatly benefit researchers in the field of oncology and 
structure-based drug design.

A promising technique of discovering disease biomarkers is to measure the 
relative protein abundance in multiple biofluid samples through liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based quantitative 
proteomics. The key step involves peptide feature detection in the LC-MS map, 
along with its charge and intensity. Existing heuristic algorithms suffer from 
inaccurate parameters and human errors. As a solution, we propose PointIso, the 
first point cloud based arbitrary-precision deep learning network to address 
this problem. It consists of attention based scanning step for segmenting the 
multi-isotopic pattern of 3D peptide features along with the charge, and a 
sequence classification step for grouping those isotopes into potential peptide 
features. PointIso achieves 98% detection of high-quality MS/MS identified 
peptide features in a benchmark dataset. Next, the model is adapted for handling 
the additional 'ion mobility' dimension and achieves 4% higher detection than 
existing algorithms on the human proteome dataset. Besides contributing to the 
proteomics study, our novel segmentation technique should serve the general 
object detection domain as well.

Breast cancer screening using Mammography serves as the earliest defense against 
breast cancer, revealing anomalous tissue years before it can be detected 
through physical screening. Despite the use of high resolution radiography, the 
presence of densely overlapping patterns challenges the consistency of 
human-driven diagnosis and drives interest in leveraging state-of-art 
localization ability of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). The growing 
availability of digitized clinical archives enables the training of deep 
segmentation models, but training using the most widely available form of coarse 
hand-drawn annotations works against learning the precise boundary of cancerous 
tissue in evaluation, while producing results that are more aligned with the 
annotations rather than the underlying lesions. The expense of collecting high 
quality pixel-level data in the field of medical science makes this even more 
difficult. To surmount this fundamental challenge, we propose LatentCADx, a deep 
learning segmentation model capable of precisely annotating cancer lesions 
underlying hand-drawn annotations, which we procedurally obtain using joint 
classification training and a strict segmentation penalty. We demonstrate the 
capability of LatentCADx on a publicly available dataset of 2,620 Mammogram case 
files, where LatentCADx obtains classification ROC of 0.97, AP of 0.87, and 
segmentation AP of 0.75 (IOU = 0.5), giving comparable or better performance 
than other models. Qualitative and precision evaluation of LatentCADx 
annotations on validation samples reveals that LatentCADx increases the 
specificity of segmentations beyond that of existing models trained on 
hand-drawn annotations, with pixel level specificity reaching a staggering value 
of 0.90. It also obtains sharp boundary around lesions unlike other methods, 
reducing the confused pixels in the output by more than 60%.

Multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide biomarkers of 
early influences on neurodevelopment such as nutrition, environmental and 
genetic factors. As the exposure to early influences can be separated from 
neurodevelopmental outcomes by many months or years, MRI markers can serve as an 
important intermediate outcome in multivariate analyses of neurodevelopmental 
determinants. Key to the success of such work are recent advances in data 
science as well as the growth of relevant data resources. Multimodal MRI 
assessment of neurodevelopment can be supplemented with other biomarkers of 
neurodevelopment such as electroencephalograms, magnetoencephalogram, and 
non-imaging biomarkers. This review focuses on how maternal nutrition impacts 
infant brain development, with three purposes: (1) to summarize the current 
knowledge about how nutrition in stages of pregnancy and breastfeeding impact 
infant brain development; (2) to discuss multimodal MRI and other measures of 
early neurodevelopment; and (3) to discuss potential opportunities for data 
science and artificial intelligence to advance precision nutrition. We hope this 
review can facilitate the collaborative march toward precision nutrition during 
pregnancy and the first year of life.

BACKGROUND: Revision endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is often considered for 
chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) if maximal conservative treatment and baseline ESS 
prove insufficient. Emerging research outlines the risk factors of revision ESS. 
However, accurately predicting revision ESS at the individual level remains 
uncertain. This study aims to examine the prediction accuracy of revision ESS 
and to identify the effects of risk factors at the individual level.
METHODS: We collected demographic and clinical variables from the electronic 
health records of 767 surgical CRS patients ≥16 years of age. Revision ESS was 
performed on 111 (14.5%) patients. The prediction accuracy of revision ESS was 
examined by training and validating different machine learning models, while the 
effects of variables were analysed using the Shapley values and partial 
dependence plots.
RESULTS: The logistic regression, gradient boosting and random forest 
classifiers performed similarly in predicting revision ESS. Area under the 
receiving operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values were 0.744, 0.741 and 
0.730, respectively, using data collected from the baseline visit until six 
months after baseline ESS. The length of time during which data were collected 
improved the prediction performance. For data collection times of 0, 3, 6 and 12 
months after baseline ESS, AUROC values for the logistic regression were 0.682, 
0.715, 0.744 and 0.784, respectively. The number of visits before or after 
baseline ESS, the number of days from the baseline visit to the baseline ESS, 
patient age, CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), asthma, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug exacerbated respiratory disease and immunodeficiency or 
suspicion of it all associated with revision ESS. Patient age and number of 
visits before baseline ESS carried non-linear effects for predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: Intelligent data analysis identified important predictors of 
revision ESS at the individual level, such as the frequency of clinical visits, 
patient age, Type 2 high diseases and immunodeficiency or a suspicion of it.

Effective implementation of artificial intelligence in behavioral healthcare 
delivery depends on overcoming challenges that are pronounced in this domain. 
Self and social stigma contribute to under-reported symptoms, and under-coding 
worsens ascertainment. Health disparities contribute to algorithmic bias. Lack 
of reliable biological and clinical markers hinders model development, and model 
explainability challenges impede trust among users. In this perspective, we 
describe these challenges and discuss design and implementation recommendations 
to overcome them in intelligent systems for behavioral and mental health.

Machine learning provides a probabilistic framework for metabolic pathway 
inference from genomic sequence information at different levels of complexity 
and completion. However, several challenges, including pathway features 
engineering, multiple mapping of enzymatic reactions, and emergent or 
distributed metabolism within populations or communities of cells, can limit 
prediction performance. In this article, we present triUMPF (triple non-negative 
matrix factorization [NMF] with community detection for metabolic pathway 
inference), which combines three stages of NMF to capture myriad relationships 
between enzymes and pathways within a graph network. This is followed by 
community detection to extract a higher-order structure based on the clustering 
of vertices that share similar statistical properties. We evaluated triUMPF 
performance by using experimental datasets manifesting diverse multi-label 
properties, including Tier 1 genomes from the BioCyc collection of organismal 
Pathway/Genome Databases and low complexity microbial communities. Resulting 
performance metrics equaled or exceeded other prediction methods on organismal 
genomes with improved precision on multi-organismal datasets.

Current first-line treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) include 
pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy. However, one-third of 
depressed patients do not achieve remission after multiple medication trials, 
and psychotherapy can be costly and time-consuming. Although non-implantable 
neuromodulation (NIN) techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, 
transcranial direct current stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy, and magnetic 
seizure therapy are gaining momentum for treating MDD, the efficacy of 
non-convulsive techniques is still modest, whereas use of convulsive modalities 
is limited by their cognitive side effects. In this context, we propose that NIN 
techniques could benefit from a precision-oriented approach. In this review, we 
discuss the challenges and opportunities in implementing such a framework, 
focusing on enhancing NIN effects via a combination of individualized cognitive 
interventions, using closed-loop approaches, identifying multimodal biomarkers, 
using computer electric field modeling to guide targeting and quantify dosage, 
and using machine learning algorithms to integrate data collected at multiple 
biological levels and identify clinical responders. Though promising, this 
framework is currently limited, as previous studies have employed small samples 
and did not sufficiently explore pathophysiological mechanisms associated with 
NIN response and side effects. Moreover, cost-effectiveness analyses have not 
been performed. Nevertheless, further advancements in clinical trials of NIN 
could shift the field toward a more "precision-oriented" practice.

BACKGROUND: Precision prevention is increasingly important in HIV prevention 
research to move beyond universal interventions to those tailored for high-risk 
individuals. The current study was designed to develop machine learning 
algorithms for predicting adolescent HIV risk behaviours.
METHODS: Comprehensive longitudinal data on adolescent risk behaviours, 
perceptions, peer and family influence, and neighbourhood risk factors were 
collected from 2564 grade-10 students at baseline followed for 24 months over 
2008-2012. Machine learning techniques [support vector machine (SVM) and random 
forests] were applied to innovatively leverage longitudinal data for robust HIV 
risk behaviour prediction. In this study, we focused on two adolescent risk 
behaviours: had ever had sex and had multiple sex partners. Twenty percent of 
the data were withheld for model testing.
RESULTS: The SVM model with cost-sensitive learning achieved the highest 
sensitivity, at 79.1%, specificity of 75.4% with AUC of 0.86 in predicting 
multiple sex partners on the training data (10-fold cross-validation), and 
sensitivity of 79.7%, specificity of 76.5% with AUC of 0.86 on the testing data. 
The random forest model obtained the best performance in predicting had ever had 
sex, yielding the sensitivity of 78.5%, specificity of 73.1% with AUC of 0.84 on 
the training data and sensitivity of 82.7%, specificity of 75.3% with AUC of 
0.87 on the testing data.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning methods can be used to build effective prediction 
model(s) to identify adolescents who are likely to engage in HIV risk 
behaviours. This study builds a foundation for targeted intervention strategies 
and informs precision prevention efforts in school-setting.

Bladder cancer is a fatal cancer that happens in the genitourinary tract with 
quite high morbidity and mortality annually. The high level of recurrence rate 
ranging from 50 to 80% makes bladder cancer one of the most challenging and 
costly diseases to manage. Faced with various problems in existing methods, a 
recently emerging concept for the measurement of imaging biomarkers and 
extraction of quantitative features called "radiomics" shows great potential in 
the application of detection, grading, and follow-up management of bladder 
cancer. Furthermore, machine-learning (ML) algorithms on the basis of "big data" 
are fueling the powers of radiomics for bladder cancer monitoring in the era of 
precision medicine. Currently, the usefulness of the novel combination of 
radiomics and ML has been demonstrated by a large number of successful cases. It 
possesses outstanding strengths including non-invasiveness, low cost, and high 
efficiency, which may serve as a revolution to tumor assessment and emancipate 
workforce. However, for the extensive clinical application in the future, more 
efforts should be made to break down the limitations caused by technology 
deficiencies, inherent problems during the process of radiomic analysis, as well 
as the quality of present studies.

Precision medicine is an active area of research that could offer an analytic 
paradigm shift for clinical trials and the subsequent treatment decisions based 
on them. Clinical trials are typically analyzed with the intent of discovering 
beneficial treatments if the same treatment is applied to the entire population 
under study. But, such a treatment strategy could be suboptimal if subsets of 
the population exhibit varying treatment effects. Identifying subsets of the 
population experiencing differential treatment effect and forming individualized 
treatment rules is a task well-suited to modern machine learning methods such as 
tree-based ensemble predictive models. Specifically, Bayesian additive 
regression trees (BART) has shown promise in this regard because of its 
exceptional performance in out-of-sample prediction. Due to the unique 
inferential needs of precision medicine for clinical trials, we have proposed 
the BART extensions explicated here. We incorporate random effects for 
longitudinal repeated measures and subject clustering within medical centers. 
The addition of a novel interaction detection prior to identify treatment 
heterogeneity among clinical trial patients and its association with patient 
characteristics. These extensions are unified under a framework that we call 
mixedBART. Simulation studies and applications of precision medicine based on 
real randomized clinical trials data examples are presented.

BACKGROUND: With the development of biomedicine, the number of biomedical 
documents has increased rapidly bringing a great challenge for researchers 
trying to retrieve the information they need. Information retrieval aims to meet 
this challenge by searching relevant documents from abundant documents based on 
the given query. However, sometimes the relevance of search results needs to be 
evaluated from multiple aspects in specific retrieval tasks, thereby increasing 
the difficulty of biomedical information retrieval.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to find a more systematic method for retrieving 
relevant scientific literature for a given patient.
METHODS: In the initial retrieval stage, we supplemented query terms through 
query expansion strategies and applied query boosting to obtain an initial 
ranking list of relevant documents. In the re-ranking phase, we employed a text 
classification model and relevance matching model to evaluate documents from 
different dimensions and then combined the outputs through logistic regression 
to re-rank all the documents from the initial ranking list.
RESULTS: The proposed ensemble method contributed to the improvement of 
biomedical retrieval performance. Compared with the existing deep learning-based 
methods, experimental results showed that our method achieved state-of-the-art 
performance on the data collection provided by the Text Retrieval Conference 
2019 Precision Medicine Track.
CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we proposed a novel ensemble method based on deep 
learning. As shown in the experiments, the strategies we used in the initial 
retrieval phase such as query expansion and query boosting are effective. The 
application of the text classification model and relevance matching model better 
captured semantic context information and improved retrieval performance.

Angular scanning-based surface plasmon resonance measurement has been utilized 
in label-free sensing applications. However, the measurement accuracy and 
precision of the surface plasmon resonance measurements rely on an accurate 
measurement of the plasmonic angle. Several methods have been proposed and 
reported in the literature to measure the plasmonic angle, including polynomial 
curve fitting, image processing, and image averaging. For intensity detection, 
the precision limit of the SPR is around 10-5 RIU to 10-6 RIU. Here, we propose 
a deep learning-based method to locate the plasmonic angle to enhance plasmonic 
angle detection without needing sophisticated post-processing, optical 
instrumentation, and polynomial curve fitting methods. The proposed deep 
learning has been developed based on a simple convolutional neural network 
architecture and trained using simulated reflectance spectra with shot noise and 
speckle noise added to generalize the training dataset. The proposed network has 
been validated in an experimental setup measuring air and nitrogen gas 
refractive indices at different concentrations. The measurement precision 
recovered from the experimental reflectance images is 4.23 × 10-6 RIU for the 
proposed artificial intelligence-based method compared to 7.03 × 10-6 RIU for 
the cubic polynomial curve fitting and 5.59 × 10-6 RIU for 2-dimensional contour 
fitting using Horner's method.

Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is a prevalent in approximately 17% of 
tumors and is associated with enhanced sensitivity to anticancer therapies 
inducing double-strand DNA breaks. Accurate detection of HRD would therefore 
allow improved patient selection and outcome of conventional and targeted 
anticancer therapies. However, current clinical assessment of HRD mainly relies 
on determining germline BRCA1/2 mutational status and is insufficient for 
adequate patient stratification as mechanisms of HRD occurrence extend beyond 
functional BRCA1/2 loss. HRD, regardless of BRCA1/2 status, is associated with 
specific forms of genomic and mutational signatures termed HRD scar. Detection 
of this HRD scar might therefore be a more reliable biomarker for HRD. This 
review discusses and compares different methods of assessing HRD and HRD scar, 
their advances into the clinic, and their potential implications for precision 
oncology.

In contrast-enhanced computed tomography, total body weight adapted contrast 
injection protocols have proven successful in achieving a homogeneous 
enhancement of vascular structures and liver parenchyma. However, because solid 
organs have greater perfusion than adipose tissue, the lean body weight 
(fat-free mass) rather than the total body weight is theorised to cause even 
more homogeneous enhancement. We included 102 consecutive patients who underwent 
a multiphase abdominal computed tomography between March 2016 and October 2019. 
Patients received contrast media (300 mgI/mL) according to bodyweight 
categories. Using regions of interest, we measured the Hounsfield unit (HU) 
increase in liver attenuation from unenhanced to contrast-enhanced computed 
tomography. Furthermore, subjective image quality was graded using a four-point 
Likert scale. An artificial intelligence algorithm automatically segmented and 
determined the body compositions and calculated the percentages of lean body 
weight. The hepatic enhancements were adjusted for iodine dose and iodine dose 
per total body weight, as well as percentage lean body weight. The associations 
between enhancement and total body weight, body mass index, and lean body weight 
were analysed using linear regression. Patients had a median age of 68 years 
(IQR: 58-74), a total body weight of 81 kg (IQR: 73 - 90), a body mass index of 
26 kg/m2 (SD: ±4.2), and a lean body weight percentage of 50% (IQR: 36 - 55). 
Mean liver enhancements in the portal venous phase were 61 ± 12 HU (≤ 70 kg), 53 
± 10 HU (70 - 90 kg), and 53 ± 7 HU (≥ 90 kg). The majority (93%) of scans were 
rated as good or excellent. Regression analysis showed significant correlations 
between liver enhancement corrected for injected total iodine and total body 
weight (r = 0.53; p < 0.001) and between liver enhancement corrected for lean 
body weight and the percentage of lean body weight (r = 0.73; p < 0.001). Most 
benefits from personalising iodine injection using %LBW additive to total body 
weight would be achieved in patients under 90 kg. Liver enhancement is more 
strongly associated with the percentage of lean body weight than with the total 
body weight or body mass index. The observed variation in liver enhancement 
might be reduced by a personalised injection based on the 
artificial-intelligence-determined percentage of lean body weight.

Challenges of health systems in Latin America and the Caribbean include 
accessibility, inequity, segmentation, and poverty. These challenges are similar 
in different countries of the region and transcend national borders. The 
increasing digital transformation of health care holds promise of more precise 
interventions, improved health outcomes, increased efficiency, and ultimately 
reduced health-care costs. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the adoption of 
digital health tools is in early stages and the quality of cancer registries, 
electronic health records, and structured databases are problematic. Cancer 
research and innovation in the region are limited due to inadequate academic 
resources and translational research is almost fully dependent on public 
funding. Regulatory complexity and extended timelines jeopardise the potential 
improvement in participation in international studies. Emerging technologies, 
artificial intelligence, big data, and cancer research represent an opportunity 
to address the health-care challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean 
collectively, by optimising national capacities, sharing and comparing best 
practices, and transferring scientific and technical capabilities.

INTRODUCTION: Precision or personalized Medicine (PM) is used for the prevention 
and treatment of diseases by considering a huge amount of information about 
individuals variables. Due to high volume of information, AI-based computational 
models are required. A large set of studies conducted to examine the PM approach 
to improve childhood clinical outcomes. Thus, the main goal of this study was to 
review the application of health information technology and especially 
artificial intelligence (AI) methods for the treatment of childhood disease 
using PM.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched up 
to December 18, 2019. Articles that focused on informatics applications for 
childhood disease PM included in this study. Included papers were classified for 
qualitative analysis and interpreting results. The results were analyzed using 
Microsoft Excel 2019.
RESULTS: From 341 citations, 62 papers met our inclusion criteria. The number of 
published papers that used AI methods to apply for PM in childhood diseases 
increased from 2010 to 2019. Our results showed that most applied methods were 
related to machine learning discipline. In terms of clinical scope, the largest 
number of clinical articles are devoted to oncology. Besides, the analysis 
showed that genomics was the most PM approach used regarding childhood disease.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review examined papers that used AI methods for 
applying PM approaches in childhood diseases from medical informatics 
perspectives. Thus, it provided new insight to researchers who are interested in 
knowing research needs in this field.

Mobilized telemedicine is becoming a key, and even necessary, facet of both 
precision health and precision medicine. In this study, we evaluate the 
capability and potential of a crowd of virtual workers-defined as vetted members 
of popular crowdsourcing platforms-to aid in the task of diagnosing autism. We 
evaluate workers when crowdsourcing the task of providing categorical ordinal 
behavioral ratings to unstructured public YouTube videos of children with autism 
and neurotypical controls. To evaluate emerging patterns that are consistent 
across independent crowds, we target workers from distinct geographic loci on 
two crowdsourcing platforms: an international group of workers on Amazon 
Mechanical Turk (MTurk) (N = 15) and Microworkers from Bangladesh (N = 56), 
Kenya (N = 23), and the Philippines (N = 25). We feed worker responses as input 
to a validated diagnostic machine learning classifier trained on 
clinician-filled electronic health records. We find that regardless of crowd 
platform or targeted country, workers vary in the average confidence of the 
correct diagnosis predicted by the classifier. The best worker responses produce 
a mean probability of the correct class above 80% and over one standard 
deviation above 50%, accuracy and variability on par with experts according to 
prior studies. There is a weak correlation between mean time spent on task and 
mean performance (r = 0.358, p = 0.005). These results demonstrate that while 
the crowd can produce accurate diagnoses, there are intrinsic differences in 
crowdworker ability to rate behavioral features. We propose a novel strategy for 
recruitment of crowdsourced workers to ensure high quality diagnostic 
evaluations of autism, and potentially many other pediatric behavioral health 
conditions. Our approach represents a viable step in the direction of 
crowd-based approaches for more scalable and affordable precision medicine.

The need to develop patient-specific interventions is apparent when one 
considers that clinical studies often report satisfactory motor gains only in a 
portion of participants. This observation provides the foundation for "precision 
rehabilitation". Tracking and predicting outcomes defining the recovery 
trajectory is key in this context. Data collected using wearable sensors provide 
clinicians with the opportunity to do so with little burden on clinicians and 
patients. The approach proposed in this paper relies on machine learning-based 
algorithms to derive clinical score estimates from wearable sensor data 
collected during functional motor tasks. Sensor-based score estimates showed 
strong agreement with those generated by clinicians. Score estimates of 
upper-limb impairment severity and movement quality were marked by a coefficient 
of determination of 0.86 and 0.79, respectively. The application of the proposed 
approach to monitoring patients' responsiveness to rehabilitation is expected to 
contribute to the development of patient-specific interventions, aiming to 
maximize motor gains.

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics 
provides systematic profiling of metabolic. Yet, its applications in precision 
medicine (disease diagnosis) have been limited by several challenges, including 
metabolite identification, information loss and low reproducibility. Here, we 
present the deep-learning-based Pseudo-Mass Spectrometry Imaging (deepPseudoMSI) 
project (https://www.deeppseudomsi.org/), which converts LC-MS raw data to 
pseudo-MS images and then processes them by deep learning for precision 
medicine, such as disease diagnosis. Extensive tests based on real data 
demonstrated the superiority of deepPseudoMSI over traditional approaches and 
the capacity of our method to achieve an accurate individualized diagnosis. Our 
framework lays the foundation for future metabolic-based precision medicine.

The emergence of large-scale human genome projects, advances in DNA sequencing 
technologies, and the massive volume of electronic medical records [EMR] shift 
the transformation of healthcare research into the next paradigm, namely 
'Precision Medicine.' This new clinical system model uses patients' genomic 
profiles and disparate healthcare data sources to a greater extent and provides 
personalized deliverables. As an advanced analytical technique, deep learning 
models significantly impact precision medicine because they can process 
voluminous amounts of diversified data with improved accuracy. Two salient 
features of deep learning models, namely processing a massive volume of 
multi-model data at multiple levels of abstraction and the ability to identify 
inherent features from the input data on their own, attract the implication of 
deep learning techniques in precision medicine research. The proposed review 
highlights the importance of deep learning-based analytical models in handling 
diversified and disparate big data sources of precision medicine. To augment 
further, state-of-the-art precision medicine research based on the taxonomy of 
deep learning models has been reviewed along with their research outcomes. The 
diversified data inputs used in research attempts, their applications, 
benchmarking data repositories, and usage of various evaluation measures for 
accuracy estimations are highlighted in this review. This review also brings out 
some promising analytical avenues of precision medicine research that give 
directions for future exploration.

To provide precision medicine for better cancer care, researchers must work on 
clinical patient data, such as electronic medical records, physiological 
measurements, biochemistry, computerized tomography scans, digital pathology, 
and the genetic landscape of cancer tissue. To interpret big biodata in cancer 
genomics, an operational flow based on artificial intelligence (AI) models and 
medical management platforms with high-performance computing must be set up for 
precision cancer genomics in clinical practice. To work in the fast-evolving 
fields of patient care, clinical diagnostics, and therapeutic services, 
clinicians must understand the fundamentals of the AI tool approach. Therefore, 
the present article covers the following four themes: (i) computational 
prediction of pathogenic variants of cancer susceptibility genes; (ii) AI model 
for mutational analysis; (iii) single-cell genomics and computational biology; 
(iv) text mining for identifying gene targets in cancer; and (v) the NVIDIA 
graphics processing units, DRAGEN field programmable gate arrays systems and AI 
medical cloud platforms in clinical next-generation sequencing laboratories. 
Based on AI medical platforms and visualization, large amounts of clinical 
biodata can be rapidly copied and understood using an AI pipeline. The use of 
innovative AI technologies can deliver more accurate and rapid cancer therapy 
targets.

The management of interstitial lung disease (ILD) may benefit from a conceptual 
shift. Increased understanding of this complex and heterogeneous group of 
disorders over the past 20 years has highlighted the need for individualised 
treatment strategies that encompass diagnostic classification and disease 
behaviour. Biomarker-based approaches to precision medicine hold the greatest 
promise. Robust, large-scale biomarker-based technologies supporting ILD 
diagnosis have been developed, and future applications relating to staging, 
prognosis and assessment of treatment response are emerging. Artificial 
intelligence may redefine our ability to base prognostic evaluation on both 
diagnosis and underlying disease processes, sharpening individualised treatment 
algorithms to a level not previously achieved. Compared with therapeutic areas 
such as oncology, precision medicine in ILD is still in its infancy. However, 
the heterogeneous nature of ILD suggests that many relevant molecular, 
environmental and behavioural targets may serve as useful biomarkers if we are 
willing to invest in their identification and validation.

In the last five years, deep learning (DL) has become the state-of-the-art tool 
for solving various tasks in medical image analysis. Among the different methods 
that have been proposed to improve the performance of Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNNs), one typical approach is the augmentation of the training data 
set through various transformations of the input image. Data augmentation is 
typically used in cases where a small amount of data is available, such as the 
majority of medical imaging problems, to present a more substantial amount of 
data to the network and improve the overall accuracy. However, the ability of 
the network to improve the accuracy of the results when a slightly modified 
version of the same input is presented is often overestimated. This 
overestimation is the result of the strong correlation between data samples when 
they are considered independently in the training phase. In this paper, we 
emphasize the importance of optimizing for accuracy as well as precision among 
multiple replicates of the same training data in the context of data 
augmentation. To this end, we propose a new approach that leverages the 
augmented data to help the network focus on the precision through a 
specifically-designed loss function, with the ultimate goal to improve both the 
overall performance and the network's precision at the same time. We present two 
different applications of DL (regression and segmentation) to demonstrate the 
strength of the proposed strategy. We think that this work will pave the way to 
a explicit use of data augmentation within the loss function that helps the 
network to be invariant to small variations of the same input samples, a 
characteristic that is always required to every application in the medical 
imaging field.

Modern agriculture incorporated a portfolio of technologies to meet the current 
demand for agricultural food production, in terms of both quality and quantity. 
In this technology-driven farming era, this portfolio of technologies has aided 
farmers to overcome many of the challenges associated with their farming 
activities by enabling precise and timely decision making on the basis of data 
that are observed and subsequently converged. In this regard, Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) holds a key place, whereby it can assist key stakeholders in 
making precise decisions regarding the conditions on their farms. Machine 
Learning (ML), which is a branch of AI, enables systems to learn and improve 
from their experience without explicitly being programmed, by imitating 
intelligent behavior in solving tasks in a manner that requires low 
computational power. For the time being, ML is involved in a variety of aspects 
of farming, assisting ranchers in making smarter decisions on the basis of the 
observed data. In this study, we provide an overview of AI-driven precision 
farming/agriculture with related work and then propose a novel cloud-based 
ML-powered crop recommendation platform to assist farmers in deciding which 
crops need to be harvested based on a variety of known parameters. Moreover, in 
this paper, we compare five predictive ML algorithms-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), 
Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and 
Support Vector Machine (SVM)-to identify the best-performing ML algorithm on 
which to build our recommendation platform as a cloud-based service with the 
intention of offering precision farming solutions that are free and open source, 
as will lead to the growth and adoption of precision farming solutions in the 
long run.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neuroimaging in motor neuron disease (MND) has traditionally 
been seen as an academic tool with limited direct relevance to individualized 
patient care. This has changed radically in recent years as computational 
imaging has emerged as a viable clinical tool with true biomarker potential. 
This transition is not only fuelled by technological advances but also by 
important conceptual developments.
RECENT FINDINGS: The natural history of MND is now evaluated by presymptomatic, 
postmortem and multi-timepoint longitudinal imaging studies. The anatomical 
spectrum of MND imaging has also been expanded from an overwhelmingly cerebral 
focus to innovative spinal and muscle applications. In contrast to the 
group-comparisons of previous studies, machine-learning and deep-learning 
approaches are increasingly utilized to model real-life diagnostic dilemmas and 
aid prognostic classification. The focus from evaluating focal structural 
changes has shifted to the appraisal of network integrity by connectivity-based 
approaches. The armamentarium of MND imaging has also been complemented by novel 
PET-ligands, spinal toolboxes and the availability of magnetoencephalography and 
high-field magnetic resonance (MR) imaging platforms.
SUMMARY: In addition to the technological and conceptual advances, collaborative 
multicentre research efforts have also gained considerable momentum. This 
opinion-piece reviews emerging trends in MND imaging and their implications to 
clinical care and drug development.

Health surveillance is an important task to track the happenings related to 
human health, and one of its areas is pharmacovigilance. Pharmacovigilance 
tracks and monitors safe use of pharmaceutical products. Pharmacovigilance 
involves tracking side effects that may be caused by medicines and other health 
related drugs. Medical professionals have a difficult time collecting this 
information. It is anticipated that social media could help to collect this data 
and track side effects. Twitter data can be used for this task given that users 
post their personal health related experiences on-line. One problem with Twitter 
data, however, is that it contains a lot of noise. Therefore, an approach is 
needed to remove the noise. In this paper, several machine learning algorithms 
including deep neural nets are used to build classifiers that can help to detect 
these Personal Experience Tweets (PETs). Finally, we propose a method called the 
Deep Gramulator that improves results. Results of the analysis are presented and 
discussed.

The scientific response to the COVID-19 pandemic has produced an abundance of 
publications, including peer-reviewed articles and preprints, across a wide 
array of disciplines, from microbiology to medicine and social sciences. 
Genomics and precision health (GPH) technologies have had a particularly 
prominent role in medical and public health investigations and response; 
however, these domains are not simply defined and it is difficult to search for 
relevant information using traditional strategies. To quantify and track the 
ongoing contributions of GPH to the COVID-19 response, the Office of Genomics 
and Precision Public Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
created the COVID-19 Genomics and Precision Health database (COVID-19 GPH), an 
open access knowledge management system and publications database that is 
continuously updated through machine learning and manual curation. As of 
February 11, 2022, COVID-GPH contained 31,597 articles, mostly on pathogen and 
human genomics (72%). The database also includes articles describing 
applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence to the 
investigation and control of COVID-19 (28%). COVID-GPH represents about 10% 
(22983/221241) of the literature on COVID-19 on PubMed. This unique knowledge 
management database makes it easier to explore, describe, and track how the 
pandemic response is accelerating the applications of genomics and precision 
health technologies. COVID-19 GPH can be freely accessed via

There is growing interest in monitoring gait patterns in people with 
neurological conditions. The democratisation of wearable inertial sensors has 
enabled the study of gait in free living environments. One pivotal aspect of 
gait assessment in uncontrolled environments is the ability to accurately 
recognise gait instances. Previous work has focused on wavelet transform methods 
or general machine learning models to detect gait; the former assume a 
comparable gait pattern between people and the latter assume training datasets 
that represent a diverse population. In this paper, we argue that these 
approaches are unsuitable for people with severe motor impairments and their 
distinct gait patterns, and make the case for a lightweight personalised 
alternative. We propose an approach that builds on top of a general model, 
fine-tuning it with personalised data. A comparative proof-of-concept evaluation 
with general machine learning (NN and CNN) approaches and personalised 
counterparts showed that the latter improved the overall accuracy in 3.5% for 
the NN and 5.3% for the CNN. More importantly, participants that were 
ill-represented by the general model (the most extreme cases) had the 
recognition of gait instances improved by up to 16.9% for NN and 20.5% for CNN 
with the personalised approaches. It is common to say that people with 
neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, present very individual 
motor patterns, and that in a sense they are all outliers; we expect that our 
results will motivate researchers to explore alternative approaches that value 
personalisation rather than harvesting datasets that are may be able to 
represent these differences.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the performance of deep learning image 
reconstruction (DLIR) with that of standard filtered back projection (FBP) and 
adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction V (ASiR-V) for measurement of the 
vascular diameter on computed tomography (CT) angiography model.
METHODS: We used 6 vascular models of 3 wall thicknesses. We used DLIR, FBP, and 
ASiR-V for reconstruction, and compared the accuracy and precision of vascular 
diameter measurement, as well as the image noise, among the 3 reconstruction 
methods.
RESULTS: Image noise was in the order of FBP > ASiR-V > DLIR. The vascular 
diameters measured using DLIR and ASiR-V were comparable with, or significantly 
closer to, the actual diameter than those measured using FBP. The precision of 
the diameter measurement using DLIR was comparable with or significantly 
superior to that using FBP/ASiR-V.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of DLIR, as compared with FBP or ASiR-V, for image 
reconstruction can improve the precision and accuracy of vascular diameter 
measurement.

The increase in the expectations of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has 
led to machine learning technology being actively used in the medical field. 
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a machine learning technique used for 
image analysis, speech recognition, and language processing; recently, it is 
being applied to medical research. Precision medicine, wherein important 
information is extracted from large-scale medical data to provide optimal 
medical care for every individual, is considered important in medical policies 
globally, and the application of machine learning techniques to this end is 
being handled in several ways. NMF is also introduced differently because of the 
characteristics of its algorithms. In this review, the importance of NMF in the 
field of medicine, with a focus on the field of oncology, is described by 
explaining the mathematical science of NMF and the characteristics of the 
algorithm, providing examples of how NMF can be used to establish precision 
medicine, and presenting the challenges of NMF. Finally, the direction regarding 
the effective use of NMF in the field of oncology is also discussed.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular outcomes for people with familial 
hypercholesterolaemia can be improved with diagnosis and medical management. 
However, 90% of individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia remain 
undiagnosed in the USA. We aimed to accelerate early diagnosis and timely 
intervention for more than 1·3 million undiagnosed individuals with familial 
hypercholesterolaemia at high risk for early heart attacks and strokes by 
applying machine learning to large health-care encounter datasets.
METHODS: We trained the FIND FH machine learning model using deidentified 
health-care encounter data, including procedure and diagnostic codes, 
prescriptions, and laboratory findings, from 939 clinically diagnosed 
individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia (395 of whom had a molecular 
diagnosis) and 83 136 individuals presumed free of familial 
hypercholesterolaemia, sampled from four US institutions. The model was then 
applied to a national health-care encounter database (170 million individuals) 
and an integrated health-care delivery system dataset (174 000 individuals). 
Individuals used in model training and those evaluated by the model were 
required to have at least one cardiovascular disease risk factor (eg, 
hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, or hyperlipidemia). A Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996-compliant programme was developed to 
allow providers to receive identification of individuals likely to have familial 
hypercholesterolaemia in their practice.
FINDINGS: Using a model with a measured precision (positive predictive value) of 
0·85, recall (sensitivity) of 0·45, area under the precision-recall curve of 
0·55, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0·89, we 
flagged 1 331 759 of 170 416 201 patients in the national database and 866 of 
173 733 individuals in the health-care delivery system dataset as likely to have 
familial hypercholesterolaemia. Familial hypercholesterolaemia experts reviewed 
a sample of flagged individuals (45 from the national database and 103 from the 
health-care delivery system dataset) and applied clinical familial 
hypercholesterolaemia diagnostic criteria. Of those reviewed, 87% (95% Cl 
73-100) in the national database and 77% (68-86) in the health-care delivery 
system dataset were categorised as having a high enough clinical suspicion of 
familial hypercholesterolaemia to warrant guideline-based clinical evaluation 
and treatment.
INTERPRETATION: The FIND FH model successfully scans large, diverse, and 
disparate health-care encounter databases to identify individuals with familial 
hypercholesterolaemia.
FUNDING: The FH Foundation funded this study. Support was received from Amgen, 
Sanofi, and Regeneron.

Advanced instrumentation whether robotic or non-robotic- hasn't itself made for 
better surgery as all critical measures of operative success depend still on 
intraoperative surgeon judgement and decision-making. Computer assisted surgery, 
or digital surgery, refers to the combination of technology with real-time data 
during an operation and is often assumed to need new hardware platforms to 
become a reality. However, methods to support personalised surgical endeavour 
exist now and can be deployed today within standard laparoscopic paradigms. Here 
we describe in detail the rationale for the deployment of such assistance for 
surgical step-advancement in our current practice evolution from traditional 
proximal colon cancer resection to complete mesocolic excision focussing on 
personalised 3d anatomical display, intraoperative, quantificative fluorescence 
assessment of intracorporeal anastomoses and postoperative digital feedback to 
enable reflection and identify areas of technical improvement.

This conceptual paper describes the current state of mental health services, 
identifies critical problems, and suggests how to solve them. I focus on the 
potential contributions of artificial intelligence and precision mental health 
to improving mental health services. Toward that end, I draw upon my own 
research, which has changed over the last half century, to highlight the need to 
transform the way we conduct mental health services research. I identify 
exemplars from the emerging literature on artificial intelligence and precision 
approaches to treatment in which there is an attempt to personalize or fit the 
treatment to the client in order to produce more effective interventions.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-bound peptides that originate from 
tumor-specific genetic alterations, known as neoantigens, are an important class 
of anticancer therapeutic targets. Accurately predicting peptide presentation by 
MHC complexes is a key aspect of discovering therapeutically relevant 
neoantigens. Technological improvements in mass-spectrometry-based 
immunopeptidomics and advanced modeling techniques have vastly improved MHC 
presentation prediction over the past two decades. However, improvement in the 
sensitivity and specificity of prediction algorithms is needed for clinical 
applications such as the development of personalized cancer vaccines, the 
discovery of biomarkers for response to checkpoint blockade, and the 
quantification of autoimmune risk in gene therapies. Toward this end, we 
generated allele-specific immunopeptidomics data using 25 monoallelic cell lines 
and created Systematic HLA Epitope Ranking Pan Algorithm (SHERPA), a pan-allelic 
MHC-peptide algorithm for predicting MHC-peptide binding and presentation. In 
contrast to previously published large-scale monoallelic data, we used an 
HLA-null K562 parental cell line and a stable transfection of HLA alleles to 
better emulate native presentation. Our dataset includes five previously 
unprofiled alleles that expand MHC-binding pocket diversity in the training data 
and extend allelic coverage in under profiled populations. To improve 
generalizability, SHERPA systematically integrates 128 monoallelic and 384 
multiallelic samples with publicly available immunoproteomics data and binding 
assay data. Using this dataset, we developed two features that empirically 
estimate the propensities of genes and specific regions within gene bodies to 
engender immunopeptides to represent antigen processing. Using a composite model 
constructed with gradient boosting decision trees, multiallelic deconvolution, 
and 2.15 million peptides encompassing 167 alleles, we achieved a 1.44-fold 
improvement of positive predictive value compared with existing tools when 
evaluated on independent monoallelic datasets and a 1.15-fold improvement when 
evaluating on tumor samples. With a high degree of accuracy, SHERPA has the 
potential to enable precision neoantigen discovery for future clinical 
applications.

BACKGROUND: Most trials in critical care have been neutral, in part because 
between-patient heterogeneity means not all patients respond identically to the 
same treatment. The Precision Care in Cardiac Arrest: Influence of Cooling 
duration on Efficacy in Cardiac Arrest Patients (PRECICECAP) study will apply 
machine learning to high-resolution, multimodality data collected from patients 
resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. We aim to discover novel 
biomarker signatures to predict the optimal duration of therapeutic hypothermia 
and 90-day functional outcomes. In parallel, we are developing a freely 
available software platform for standardized curation of intensive care 
unit-acquired data for machine learning applications.
METHODS: The Influence of Cooling duration on Efficacy in Cardiac Arrest 
Patients (ICECAP) study is a response-adaptive, dose-finding trial testing 
different durations of therapeutic hypothermia. Twelve ICECAP sites will collect 
data for PRECICECAP from multiple modalities routinely used after 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, including ICECAP case report forms, detailed 
medication data, cardiopulmonary and electroencephalographic waveforms, and 
digital imaging and communications in medicine files (DICOMs). We partnered with 
Moberg Analytics to develop a freely available software platform to allow 
high-resolution critical care data to be used efficiently and effectively. We 
will use an autoencoder neural network to create low-dimensional representations 
of all raw waveforms and derivative features, censored at rewarming to ensure 
clinical usability to guide optimal duration of hypothermia. We will also 
consider simple features that are historically considered to be important. 
Finally, we will create a supervised deep learning neural network algorithm to 
directly predict 90-day functional outcome from large sets of novel features.
RESULTS: PRECICECAP is currently enrolling and will be completed in late 2025.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac arrest is a heterogeneous disease that causes substantial 
morbidity and mortality. PRECICECAP will advance the overarching goal of 
titrating personalized neurocritical care on the basis of robust measures of 
individual need and treatment responsiveness. The software platform we develop 
will be broadly applicable to hospital-based research after acute illness or 
injury.

Clinical trials are fundamental for advances in cancer treatment. The 
traditional framework of phase 1 to 3 trials is designed for incremental 
advances between regimens. However, our ability to understand and treat cancer 
has evolved with the increase in drugs targeting an expanding array of 
therapeutic targets, the development of progressively comprehensive data sets, 
and emerging computational analytics, all of which are reshaping our treatment 
strategies. A more robust linkage between drugs and underlying cancer biology is 
blurring historical lines that define trials on the basis of cancer type. The 
complexity of the molecular basis of cancer, coupled with manifold variations in 
clinical status, is driving the individually tailored use of combinations of 
precision targeted drugs. This approach is spawning a new era of clinical trial 
types. Although most care is delivered in a community setting, large centers 
support real-time multi-omic analytics and their integrated interpretation by 
using machine learning in the context of real-world data sets. Coupling the 
analytic capabilities of large centers to the tailored delivery of therapy in 
the community is forging a paradigm that is optimizing service for patients. 
Understanding the importance of these evolving trends across the health care 
spectrum will affect our treatment of cancer in the future and is the focus of 
this review.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the ability to predict individual unfavourable future 
status and development in the 20m shuttle run test (20MSRT) during adolescence 
with machine learning (random forest (RF) classifier).
METHODS: Data from a 2-year observational study (2013‒2015, 12.4±1.3 years, 
n=633, 50% girls), with 48 baseline characteristics (questionnaires 
(demographics, physical, psychological, social and lifestyle factors), objective 
measurements (anthropometrics, fitness characteristics, physical activity, body 
composition and academic scores)) were used to predict: (Task 1) unfavourable 
future 20MSRT status (identification of individuals in the lowest 20MSRT tertile 
after 2 years), and (Task 2) unfavourable 20MSRT development (identification of 
individuals with 20MSRT development in the lowest tertile among adolescents with 
baseline 20MSRT below median level).
RESULTS: Prediction performance for future 20MSRT status (Task 1) was (area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) 83% and 76%, sensitivity 
80% and 60%, and specificity 78% and 79% in girls and boys, respectively. Twenty 
variables showed predictive power in boys, 14 in girls, including fitness 
characteristics, physical activity, academic scores, adiposity, life enjoyment, 
parental support, social status in school and perceived fitness.Prediction 
performance for future development (Task 2) was lower and differed statistically 
from random level only in girls (AUC 68% and 40% in girls and boys).
CONCLUSION: RF classifier predicted future unfavourable status in 20MSRT and 
identified potential individuals for interventions based on a holistic profile 
(14‒20 baseline characteristics). The MATLAB script and functions employing the 
RF classifier of this study are available for future precision exercise medicine 
research.

Ischemic stroke (IS), the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, is 
caused by many modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. This complex disease 
is also known for its multiple etiologies with moderate heritability. Polygenic 
risk scores (PRSs), which have been used to establish a common genetic basis for 
IS, may contribute to IS risk stratification for disease/outcome prediction and 
personalized management. Statistical modeling and machine learning algorithms 
have contributed significantly to this field. For instance, multiple algorithms 
have been successfully applied to PRS construction and integration of genetic 
and non-genetic features for outcome prediction to aid in risk stratification 
for personalized management and prevention measures. PRS derived from variants 
with effect size estimated based on the summary statistics of a specific subtype 
shows a stronger association with the matched subtype. The disruption of the 
extracellular matrix and amyloidosis account for the pathogenesis of cerebral 
small vessel disease (CSVD). Pathway-specific PRS analyses confirm known and 
identify novel etiologies related to IS. Some of these specific PRSs (e.g., 
derived from endothelial cell apoptosis pathway) individually contribute to 
post-IS mortality and, together with clinical risk factors, better predict 
post-IS mortality. In this review, we summarize the genetic basis of IS, 
emphasizing the application of methodologies and algorithms used to construct 
PRSs and integrate genetics into risk models.

INTRODUCTION: The search for drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) has failed 
to yield effective therapies. Here we report the first genome-wide search for 
biomarkers associated with therapeutic response in AD. Blarcamesine 
(ANAVEX2-73), a selective sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) agonist, was studied in a 
57-week Phase 2a trial (NCT02244541). The study was extended for a further 
208 weeks (NCT02756858) after meeting its primary safety endpoint.
METHODS: Safety, clinical features, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy, measured by 
changes in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer's Disease 
Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL), were recorded. 
Whole exome and transcriptome sequences were obtained for 21 patients. The 
relationship between all available patient data and efficacy outcome measures 
was analyzed with unsupervised formal concept analysis (FCA), integrated in the 
Knowledge Extraction and Management (KEM) environment.
RESULTS: Biomarkers with a significant impact on clinical outcomes were 
identified at week 57: mean plasma concentration of blarcamesine (slope 
MMSE:P < .041), genomic variants SIGMAR1 p.Gln2Pro (ΔMMSE:P < .039; 
ΔADCS-ADL:P < .063) and COMT p.Leu146fs (ΔMMSE:P < .039; ΔADCS-ADL:P < .063), 
and baseline MMSE score (slope MMSE:P < .015). Their combined impact on drug 
response was confirmed at week 148 with linear mixed effect models.
DISCUSSION: Confirmatory Phase 2b/3 clinical studies of these patient selection 
markers are ongoing. This FCA/KEM analysis is a template for the identification 
of patient selection markers in early therapeutic development for neurologic 
disorders.

OBJECTIVES: The current challenges of psychiatric nosology and semiology are 
part of an interdisciplinary and integrative framework. The paradigm of the 
personalized and precision psychiatry proposes to study this discipline 
according to new approaches and methodologies. Personalized and precision 
psychiatry therefore requires clarification of its concepts. To our knowledge, 
there is no systematic exploration of the literature on the application of the 
concepts of personalized and precision medicine in the field of psychiatry. This 
article proposes thus to explore the framework of personalized and precision 
medicine applied to psychiatry.
METHODS: We explored the framework of personalized and precision medicine 
applied to psychiatry by a textual network analysis. Firstly, we performed a 
systematic text-mining (Natural Language Processing) from an exhaustive review 
of the international literature with the terms "precision psychiatry" and 
"personalized psychiatry". Secondly, this analysis of textual data allowed us to 
build a textual network which made it possible to visualize the most proximal 
terms (the most frequently associated in the literature). Finally, we extracted 
from the network the main dimensions explored in the scientific literature, and 
we studied the relative importance of each term by analyzing the network 
centrality. In addition, a brief bibliometric analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: We show that personalized and precision psychiatry refers to six 
dimensions found in the textual network analysis which correspond to the 
scientific fields which study personalized and precision psychiatry: genetics, 
pharmacogenetics, artificial intelligence, therapeutic trials, biomarkers and 
staging. We explore how each dimension relates to the mechanization of 
psychiatric disorders. However, precision and personalized psychiatry, which 
tries to refine the levels of mechanistic explanations for psychiatry, suffers 
from a conceptual heterogeneity. Indeed, textual analysis also allows us to find 
terms referring to a set of heterogeneous concepts. Many methodological fields 
and epistemological concepts are invoked in this literature, without 
standardization.
CONCLUSIONS: The paradox of personalized and precision psychiatry is to 
associate a strong conceptual heterogeneity with a well-defined mechanistic 
component. Heterogeneity found in literature on personalized and precision 
psychiatry testifies to the lack of a pluralist and integrative theoretical 
framework. This framework could be based on a naturalizing but non-reducing 
formalism, aware of the societal challenges of the sciences and their 
implementation in the research and clinical systems of psychiatry.

BACKGROUND: Prediction of the change in fold stability (ΔΔG) of a protein upon 
mutation is of major importance to protein engineering and screening of 
disease-causing variants. Many prediction methods can use 3D structural 
information to predict ΔΔG. While the performance of these methods has been 
extensively studied, a new problem has arisen due to the abundance of crystal 
structures: How precise are these methods in terms of structure input used, 
which structure should be used, and how much does it matter? Thus, there is a 
need to quantify the structural sensitivity of protein stability prediction 
methods.
RESULTS: We computed the structural sensitivity of six widely-used prediction 
methods by use of saturated computational mutagenesis on a diverse set of 87 
structures of 25 proteins. Our results show that structural sensitivity varies 
massively and surprisingly falls into two very distinct groups, with methods 
that take detailed account of the local environment showing a sensitivity 
of ~ 0.6 to 0.8 kcal/mol, whereas machine-learning methods display much lower 
sensitivity (~ 0.1 kcal/mol). We also observe that the precision correlates with 
the accuracy for mutation-type-balanced data sets but not generally reported 
accuracy of the methods, indicating the importance of mutation-type balance in 
both contexts.
CONCLUSIONS: The structural sensitivity of stability prediction methods varies 
greatly and is caused mainly by the models and less by the actual protein 
structural differences. As a new recommended standard, we therefore suggest that 
ΔΔG values are evaluated on three protein structures when available and the 
associated standard deviation reported, to emphasize not just the accuracy but 
also the precision of the method in a specific study. Our observation that 
machine-learning methods deemphasize structure may indicate that folded 
wild-type structures alone, without the folded mutant and unfolded structures, 
only add modest value for assessing protein stability effects, and that 
side-chain-sensitive methods overstate the significance of the folded wild-type 
structure.

The COVID-19 pandemic has altered healthcare delivery platforms from traditional 
face-to-face formats to online care through digital tools. The healthcare 
industry saw a rapid adoption of digital collaborative tools to provide care to 
patients, regardless of where patients or clinicians were located, while 
mitigating the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. Information technologies now 
allow healthcare providers to continue a high level of care for their patients 
through virtual visits, and to collaborate with other providers in the networks. 
Population health can be improved by social determinants of health and precision 
medicine working together. However, these two health-enhancing constructs work 
independently, resulting in suboptimal health results. This paper argues that 
artificial intelligence can provide clinical-community linkage that enhances 
overall population health. An exploratory roadmap is proposed.

Defects in graphene can profoundly impact its extraordinary properties, 
ultimately influencing the performances of graphene-based nanodevices. Methods 
to detect defects with atomic resolution in graphene can be technically 
demanding and involve complex sample preparations. An alternative approach is to 
observe the thermal vibration properties of the graphene sheet, which reflects 
defect information but in an implicit fashion. Machine learning, an emerging 
data-driven approach that offers solutions to learning hidden patterns from 
complex data, has been extensively applied in material design and discovery 
problems. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach to detect 
graphene defects by discovering the hidden correlation between defect locations 
and thermal vibration features. Two prediction strategies are developed: an 
atom-based method which constructs data by atom indices, and a domain-based 
method which constructs data by domain discretization. Results show that while 
the atom-based method is capable of detecting a single-atom vacancy, the 
domain-based method can detect an unknown number of multiple vacancies up to 
atomic precision. Both methods can achieve approximately a 90% prediction 
accuracy on the reserved data for testing, indicating a promising extrapolation 
into unseen future graphene configurations. The proposed strategy offers 
promising solutions for the non-destructive evaluation of nanomaterials and 
accelerates new material discoveries.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that have a key role in the 
regulation of gene expression. The importance of miRNAs is widely acknowledged 
by the community nowadays and computational methods are needed for the precise 
prediction of novel candidates to miRNA. This task can be done by searching 
homologous with sequence alignment tools, but results are restricted to 
sequences that are very similar to the known miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). 
Besides, a very important property of pre-miRNAs, their secondary structure, is 
not taken into account by these methods. To fill this gap, many machine learning 
approaches were proposed in the last years. However, the methods are generally 
tested in very controlled conditions. If these methods were used under real 
conditions, the false positives increase and the precisions fall quite below 
those published. This work provides a novel approach for dealing with the 
computational prediction of pre-miRNAs: a convolutional deep residual neural 
network (mirDNN). This model was tested with several genomes of animals and 
plants, the full-genomes, achieving a precision up to 5 times larger than other 
approaches at the same recall rates. Furthermore, a novel validation methodology 
was used to ensure that the performance reported in this study can be 
effectively achieved when using mirDNN in novel species. To provide fast an easy 
access to mirDNN, a web demo is available at 
http://sinc.unl.edu.ar/web-demo/mirdnn/. The demo can process FASTA files with 
multiple sequences to calculate the prediction scores and generates the 
nucleotide importance plots. FULL SOURCE CODE:

It remains a mystery as to how neurons are connected and thereby enable use to 
think, and volume reconstruction from series of microscopy sections of brains is 
a vital technique in determining this connectivity. Image registration is a key 
component; the aim of image registration is to estimate the deformation field 
between two images. Current methods choose to directly regress the deformation 
field; however, this task is very challenging. It is common to trade off 
computational complexity with precision when designing complex models for 
deformation field estimation. This approach is very inefficient, leading to a 
long inference time. In this paper, we suggest that complex models are not 
necessary and solve this dilemma by proposing a dual-network architecture. We 
divide the deformation field prediction problem into two relatively simple 
subproblems and solve each of them on one branch of the proposed dual network. 
The two subproblems have completely opposite properties, and we fully utilize 
these properties to simplify the design of the dual network. These simple 
architectures enable high-speed image registration. The two branches are able to 
work together and make up for each other's drawbacks, and no loss of accuracy 
occurs even when simple architectures are involved. Furthermore, we introduce a 
series of loss functions to enable the joint training of the two networks in an 
unsupervised manner without introducing costly manual annotations. The 
experimental results reveal that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods 
in fly brain electron microscopy image registration tasks, and further ablation 
studies enable us to obtain a comprehensive understanding of each component of 
our network.

Mental disorders (MDs) with onset in childhood or adolescence include 
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) (intellectual disability and specific 
learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, attention deficit disorder (ADHD), and 
autism spectrum disorders (ASD)), as well as a broad range of mental health 
disorders (MHDs), including anxiety, depressive, stress-related and psychotic 
disorders. There is a high co-morbidity of NDDs and MHDs. Globally, there have 
been dramatic increases in the diagnosis of childhood-onset mental disorders, 
with a 2- to 3-fold rise in prevalence for several MHDs in the US over the past 
20 years. Depending on the type of MD, children often grapple with social and 
communication deficits and difficulties adapting to changes in their 
environment, which can impact their ability to learn effectively. To improve 
outcomes for children, it is important to provide timely and effective 
interventions. This review summarises the range and effectiveness of AI-assisted 
tools, developed using machine learning models, which have been applied to 
address learning challenges in students with a range of NDDs. Our review 
summarises the evidence that AI tools can be successfully used to improve social 
interaction and supportive education. Based on the limitations of existing AI 
tools, we provide recommendations for the development of future AI tools with a 
focus on providing personalised learning for individuals with NDDs.

INTRODUCTION: The electrocardiogram (ECG) plays an important role in the 
diagnosis of heart diseases. However, most patterns of diseases are based on old 
datasets and stepwise algorithms that provide limited accuracy. Improving 
diagnostic accuracy of the ECG can be done by applying machine learning 
algorithms. This requires taking existing scanned or printed ECGs of old cohorts 
and transforming the ECG signal to the raw digital (time (milliseconds), voltage 
(millivolts)) form.
OBJECTIVES: We present a MATLAB-based tool and algorithm that converts a printed 
or scanned format of the ECG into a digitized ECG signal.
METHODS: 30 ECG scanned curves are utilized in our study. An image processing 
method is first implemented for detecting the ECG regions of interest and 
extracting the ECG signals. It is followed by serial steps that digitize and 
validate the results.
RESULTS: The validation demonstrates very high correlation values of several 
standard ECG parameters: PR interval 0.984 +/-0.021 (p-value < 0.001), QRS 
interval 1+/- SD (p-value < 0.001), QT interval 0.981 +/- 0.023 p-value < 0.001, 
and RR interval 1 +/- 0.001 p-value < 0.001.
CONCLUSION: Digitized ECG signals from existing paper or scanned ECGs can be 
obtained with more than 95% of precision. This makes it possible to utilize 
historic ECG signals in machine learning algorithms to identify patterns of 
heart diseases and aid in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of patients 
with cardiovascular disease.

A Synthetic Literature Review on the Management of Emerging Treatment Resistance 
in First Episode Psychosis: Can We Move towards Precision Intervention and

Treatment resistance is prevalent in early intervention in psychosis services, 
and causes a significant burden for the individual. A wide range of variables 
are shown to contribute to treatment resistance in first episode psychosis 
(FEP). Heterogeneity in illness course and the complex, multidimensional nature 
of the concept of recovery calls for an evidence base to better inform practice 
at an individual level. Current gold standard treatments, adopting a 'one-size 
fits all' approach, may not be addressing the needs of many individuals. This 
following review will provide an update and critical appraisal of current 
clinical practices and methodological approaches for understanding, identifying, 
and managing early treatment resistance in early psychosis. Potential new 
treatments along with new avenues for research will be discussed. Finally, we 
will discuss and critique the application and translation of machine learning 
approaches to aid progression in this area. The move towards 'big data' and 
machine learning holds some prospect for stratifying intervention-based 
subgroups of individuals. Moving forward, better recognition of early treatment 
resistance is needed, along with greater sophistication and precision in 
predicting outcomes, so that effective evidence-based treatments can be 
appropriately tailored to the individual. Understanding the antecedents and the 
early trajectory of one's illness may also be key to understanding the factors 
that drive illness course.

Up to 50% of antibiotic use in hospital settings is suboptimal. We build machine 
learning models trained on electronic health record data to minimize wasteful 
use of antibiotics. Our classifiers flag no growth blood and urine microbial 
cultures with high precision. Further, we build models that predict the 
likelihood of bacterial susceptibility to sets of antibiotics. These models 
contain decision thresholds that separate subgroups of patients whose 
susceptibility rates to narrow-spectrum antibiotics equal overall susceptibility 
rates to broader-spectrum drugs. Retroactively analyzing these thresholds on our 
one year test set, we find that 14% of patients infected with Escherichia coli 
and empirically treated with piperacillin/tazobactam could have been treated 
with ceftriaxone with coverage equal to the overall susceptibility rate 
ofpiperacillin/tazobactam. Similarly, 13% of the same cohort could have been 
treated with cefazolin - a first generation cephalosporin.

OBJECTIVE: Despite there is a wide range of antidepressants available, with 
various mechanisms of actions, the efficacy of current therapeutic options is 
yet satisfactory. Previous shreds of evidence have indicated that genetics, 
cognitive, neuroendocrine, as well as personality factors, are all intrinsically 
linked and contribute to the diversity of treatment outcomes. We, therefore, 
sought to investigate this hypothesis in this study.
METHOD: Based on 610 samples treated with a selection of serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), 
noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) or tricyclic 
antidepressant (TCA), we compared the therapeutic effects of these four classes 
of drugs by survival analyses. Pharmacogenomic and survival analyses were 
carried out to explore the hereditary factors for curative effect and the 
accumulation of genetic factors was further discussed through pathway analysis 
and the global test. We built a machine learning-based prediction model that 
integrates genetic and non-genetic factors (including cognition, endocrinology, 
personality intelligence) to distinguish drug efficacy in single class drug 
situations. The values of the non-genetic makers after 6 weeks' treatment were 
collected to evaluate the efficacy of the model.
RESULTS: Our results from the 6-week antidepressant therapeutic study indicated 
that SSRI and SNRI are better treatments than those of TCA and NaSSA in the 
Chinese population. Among all possible paired single-agent survival analyses, 
citalopram and venlafaxine were more effective than mirtazapine. Allele C 
carriers at rs6354 (SLC6A4) and allele G carriers at rs12150214 (SLC6A4) were 
significantly prone to poorer treatment response to fluoxetine. Besides, the 
combination of three loci (rs929377-rs6191-rs32897) located in HPA pathway was 
significantly associated with the treatment outcome of fluoxetine. In female MDD 
patients, the minor allele of rs6323 and rs1137070 on the MAOA gene likely lead 
to a worse response to venlafaxine. Furthermore, genetic variants linked to drug 
efficacy tended to concentrate on the neurotrophin pathway in depressed patients 
comorbid with anxiety. From multivariate models, more severe cognitive deficits, 
psychopathic personality and lower levels of operational intelligence, and 
higher levels of cortisol predicted worse response status with SSRI or SNRI 
after 6-week treatment. Notably, genetic factors in the multi-dimensional 
prediction model for both classes of drugs include loci in HTR2A and CRHBP 
genes.
CONCLUSION: SSRI and SNRI are more suitable for the treatment of Chinese people 
with depression. SLC6A4 genetic variants, as well as HPA pathway, play an 
important role in the fluoxetine antidepressant therapeutic response while the 
polymorphism of MAOA gene involved in the pharmacological action of venlafaxine 
among female MDD patients. The presence of anxiety in MDD patients was related 
to the neurotrophin pathway. Genetic, cognitive, neuroendocrine, and personality 
intelligence factors combined have an ensemble impact on the medication effect 
of patients with major depression, leading to more precise and personalized 
medicine for specific groups of people.

ApreciseKUre is a multi-purpose digital platform facilitating data collection, 
integration and analysis for patients affected by Alkaptonuria (AKU), an 
ultra-rare autosomal recessive genetic disease. It includes genetic, 
biochemical, histopathological, clinical, therapeutic resources and quality of 
life scores that can be shared among registered researchers and clinicians in 
order to create a Precision Medicine Ecosystem (PME). The combination of machine 
learning application to analyse and re-interpret data available in the 
ApreciseKUre shows the potential direct benefits to achieve patient 
stratification and the consequent tailoring of care and treatments to a specific 
subgroup of patients. In this study, we have developed a tool able to 
investigate the most suitable treatment for AKU patients in accordance with 
their Quality of Life scores, which indicates changes in health status 
before/after the assumption of a specific class of drugs. This fact highlights 
the necessity of development of patient databases for rare diseases, like 
ApreciseKUre. We believe this is not limited to the study of AKU, but it 
represents a proof of principle study that could be applied to other rare 
diseases, allowing data management, analysis, and interpretation.

The rise of omics technologies that simultaneously measure thousands of 
molecules in a complex biological sample represents the core of systems biology. 
These technologies have profoundly impacted biomarkers and therapeutic targets 
discovery in the precision medicine era. Systems biology aims to perform a 
systematic probing of complex interactions in biological systems. Powered by 
high-throughput omics technologies and high-performance computing, systems 
biology provides relevant, resolving, and multi-scale overviews from cells to 
populations. Precision medicine takes advantage of these conceptual and 
technological developments and is based on two main pillars: the generation of 
multimodal data and their subsequent modeling. High-throughput omics 
technologies enable the comprehensive and holistic extraction of biological 
information, while computational capabilities enable multidimensional modeling 
and, as a result, offer an intuitive and intelligible visualization. Despite 
their promise, translating these technologies into clinically actionable tools 
has been slow. In this contribution, we present the most recent multi-omics data 
generation and analysis strategies and their clinical deployment in the 
post-genomic era. Furthermore, medical application challenges of omics-based 
biomarkers are discussed.

Introduction: In cancer, there are survival-based staging systems and tailored, 
stage-based treatments. There is little personalized treatment in vascular 
disease. The 2019 Global Vascular Guidelines on the Management of CLTI proposed 
successful treatment hinges upon Patient risk, Limb severity, and ANatomic 
complexity (PLAN). We sought to confirm a three axis approach and define how 
increasing severity affects mortality, not just limb loss. Methods: Patients 
revascularized for incident CLTI at our institution from 2013 to 2017 were 
included. Outcomes were mortality, limb loss, the composite endpoint of 
amputation-free survival. Using Bayesian machine learning, specifically 
supervised topic modeling, clusters of patient features associated with 
mortality were formed after controlling for revascularization type. Patients 
were assigned to the cluster they belonged to with highest probability; clusters 
were characterized by analyzing the characteristics of patients within them. 
Patient outcomes were used to order the clusters into stages with increasing 
mortality. Results: We defined three distinct clusters as the basis for patient- 
and limb-centered stages. Across stages, rates of 1-year mortality were 7.6, 
13.8, 18.9% and rates of amputation-free survival were 84.8, 79.3, and 63.2%. 
Stage one had patients with rest pain and previous revascularization who were 
less likely to have wounds, diabetes, and renal disease. Stage two had doubled 
mortality, likely related to diabetes prevalence. Stage three is characterized 
by high rates of complicated comorbidities, particularly end stage renal 
disease, and significantly higher rate of limb loss (22.6 vs. 8% in stages one 
and two). Conclusion: Using precision medicine, we have demonstrated clustering 
of CLTI patients that can be used toward a robust staging system. We provide 
empiric evidence for PLAN and detail about how changes in each variable affect 
survival and amputation-free survival.

The objective of this retrospective observational cohort study was to measure 
glycemic variability and reductions in body mass index (BMI), blood pressure 
(BP), and use of antihypertensive medications in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients 
participating in the digital twin-enabled Twin Precision Treatment (TPT) 
Program. Study participants included 19 females and 45 males with T2D who chose 
to participate in the TPT Program and adhered to program protocols. Nine 
additional enrollees were excluded due to major program non-adherence. Enrollees 
were required to have adequate hepatic and renal function, no myocardial 
infarction, stroke, or angina ≤ 90 days before enrollment, and no history of 
ketoacidosis or major psychiatric disorders. The TPT program uses Digital Twin 
technology, machine learning algorithms, and precision nutrition to aid 
treatment of patients with T2D. Each study participant had ≥ 3 months of 
follow-up. Outcome measures included glucose percentage coefficient of variation 
(%CV), low blood glucose index (LBGI), high blood glucose index (HBGI), systolic 
and diastolic BP, number of antihypertensive medications, and BMI. Sixty-four 
patients participated in the program. Mean (± standard deviation) %CV, LBGI, and 
HBGI values were low (17.34 ± 4.35, 1.37 ± 1.37, and 2.13 ± 2.79, respectively) 
throughout the 90-day program. BMI decreased from 29.23 ± 5.83 at baseline to 
27.43 ± 5.25 kg/m2. Systolic BP fell from 134.72 ± 17.73 to 124.58 ± 11.62 mm 
Hg. Diastolic BP decreased from 83.95 ± 10.20 to 80.33 ± 7.04 mm Hg. The percent 
of patients taking antihypertensive medications decreased from 35.9% at baseline 
to 4.7% at 90 days. During 90 days of the TPT Program, patients achieved low 
glycemic variability and significant reductions in BMI and BP. Antihypertensive 
medication use was eliminated in nearly all patients. Future research will focus 
on randomized case-control comparisons.

Previously, doctors interpreted computed tomography (CT) images based on their 
experience in diagnosing kidney diseases. However, with the rapid increase in CT 
images, such interpretations were required considerable time and effort, 
producing inconsistent results. Several novel neural network models were 
proposed to automatically identify kidney or tumor areas in CT images for 
solving this problem. In most of these models, only the neural network structure 
was modified to improve accuracy. However, data pre-processing was also a 
crucial step in improving the results. This study systematically discussed the 
necessary pre-processing methods before processing medical images in a neural 
network model. The experimental results were shown that the proposed 
pre-processing methods or models significantly improve the accuracy rate 
compared with the case without data pre-processing. Specifically, the dice score 
was improved from 0.9436 to 0.9648 for kidney segmentation and 0.7294 for all 
types of tumor detections. The performance was suitable for clinical 
applications with lower computational resources based on the proposed medical 
image processing methods and deep learning models. The cost efficiency and 
effectiveness were also achieved for automatic kidney volume calculation and 
tumor detection accurately.

PECLIDES Neuro: A Personalisable Clinical Decision Support System for 
Neurological Diseases.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's impact millions 
of people worldwide. Early diagnosis has proven to greatly increase the chances 
of slowing down the diseases' progression. Correct diagnosis often relies on the 
analysis of large amounts of patient data, and thus lends itself well to support 
from machine learning algorithms, which are able to learn from past diagnosis 
and see clearly through the complex interactions of a patient's symptoms and 
data. Unfortunately, many contemporary machine learning techniques fail to 
reveal details about how they reach their conclusions, a property considered 
fundamental when providing a diagnosis. Here we introduce our Personalisable 
Clinical Decision Support System (PECLIDES), an algorithmic process formulated 
to address this specific fault in diagnosis detection. PECLIDES provides a clear 
insight into the decision-making process leading to a diagnosis, making it a 
gray box model. Our algorithm enriches the fundamental work of Masheyekhi and 
Gras in data integration, personal medicine, usability, visualization, and 
interactivity. Our decision support system is an operation of translational 
medicine. It is based on random forests, is personalisable and allows a clear 
insight into the decision-making process. A well-structured rule set is created 
and every rule of the decision-making process can be observed by the user 
(physician). Furthermore, the user has an impact on the creation of the final 
rule set and the algorithm allows the comparison of different diseases as well 
as regional differences in the same disease. The algorithm is applicable to 
various decision problems. In this paper we will evaluate it on diagnosing 
neurological diseases and therefore refer to the algorithm as PECLIDES Neuro.

This paper describes the development of a modular unmanned aerial vehicle for 
the detection and eradication of weeds on farmland. Precision agriculture 
entails solving the problem of poor agricultural yield due to competition for 
nutrients by weeds and provides a faster approach to eliminating the problematic 
weeds using emerging technologies. This research has addressed the 
aforementioned problem. A quadcopter was built, and components were assembled 
with light-weight materials. The system consists of the electric motor, 
electronic speed controller, propellers, frame, lithium polymer (li-po) battery, 
flight controller, a global positioning system (GPS), and receiver. A sprayer 
module which consists of a relay, Raspberry Pi 3, spray pump, 12 V DC source, 
water hose, and the tank was built. It operated in such a way that when a weed 
is detected based on the deep learning algorithms deployed on the Raspberry Pi, 
general purpose input/output (GPIO) 17 or GPIO 18 (of the Raspberry Pi) were 
activated to supply 3.3 V, which turned on a DC relay to spray herbicides 
accordingly. The sprayer module was mounted on the quadcopter and from the 
test-running operation conducted, broadleaf and grass weeds were accurately 
detected and the spraying of herbicides according to the weed type occurred in 
less than a second.

High-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) for van der Waals systems with 
spectroscopic accuracy, is of great importance for quantum dynamics and an 
extremely challenge job. CO-N2 is a typical van der Waals system and its 
high-precision PES may help elucidate weak interaction mechanisms. Taking CO-N2 
potential energies calculated by CCSD(T)-F12b/aug-cc-pVQZ as the benchmark, we 
establish an accurate, robust, and efficient machine learning model by using 
only four molecular structure descriptors based on 7966 benchmark potential 
energies. The highest accuracy is obtained by a stacking ensemble DNN (SeDNN). 
Its evaluation parameters MAE, RMSE, and R2 reach 0.096, 0.163, 0.9999 cm-1 , 
respectively, and the spectroscopic accuracy for vibration spectrum is achieved 
with predicted PES, which shows SeDNN superior goodness-of-fit and prediction 
performance. An elaborated PES with the reported global minimum has been 
predicted with the model, which perfectly reproduces CCSD(T) potential energies 
and the analytical MLR PES [PCCP, 2018, 20, 2036]. The critical points (global 
minimum, TSI, TSII, and their barriers), potential curve, and entire PES profile 
are remarkably consistent with CCSD(T) calculations. To further improve the 
usability of constructing PESs in practice, the size of the training set (energy 
points) for the model is reduced to 50%, 30%, and 20% of the database, 
respectively. The results show that even training with the smallest training set 
(1593 points), the PES only differs 2.555 cm-1 with the analytic MLR PES. 
Therefore, the proposed SeDNN is promisingly an alternative efficient tool to 
construct subtle PES for van der Waals systems.

Identifying daily oviposition events for individual broiler breeders is 
important for bird management. Identifying non-laying birds in a flock that 
might be caused by improper nutrition or diseases can guide diet changes or 
disease treatments for these individuals. Oviposition depends on follicle 
maturation and egg formation, and follicle maturation can be variable. As such, 
the day and time of oviposition events of individual birds in a free-run flock 
can be hard to predict. Based on a precision feeding (PF) system that can record 
the feeding activity of individual birds, a recent study reported a machine 
learning model to predict daily egg-laying events of broiler breeders. However, 
there were 2 limitations in that study: 1) It could only be used to identify 
daily egg-laying events on a subsequent day; 2) The prediction outputs that were 
binary labels were unable to indicate more details among the outputs with the 
same label. To improve the previous approach, the current study aimed to predict 
and output the probability of daily oviposition events occurring using a 
specific time point in 1 day. In the current study, 706 egg-laying events 
recorded by nest boxes with radio frequency identification of hens and 706 
randomly selected no-egg-laying events were used. The anchor point was newly 
defined in the current study as a specific time point in 1 day, and 26 features 
around the anchor point were created for all events (706 egg-laying events and 
706 no-egg-laying events). A feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) model 
was built for prediction. The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve was 0.9409, indicating that the model had an outstanding 
classification performance. The ANN model could predict oviposition events on 
the current day, and the output was a probability that could be informative to 
indicate the likelihood of an oviposition event for an individual breeder. In 
situations where total egg production was known for a group, the ANN model could 
predict the probability of daily oviposition events occurring of all individual 
birds and then rank them to choose those most likely to have laid an egg.

Standardized programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) assessment in non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) is challenging, owing to inter-observer variability among 
pathologists and the use of different antibodies. There is a strong demand for 
the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) system to obtain 
high-precision scores of PD-L1 expression in clinical diagnostic scenarios. We 
developed an AI system using whole slide images (WSIs) of the 22c3 assay to 
automatically assess the tumor proportion score (TPS) of PD-L1 expression based 
on a deep learning (DL) model of tumor detection. Tests were performed to show 
the diagnostic ability of the AI system in the 22c3 assay to assist pathologists 
and the reliability of the application in the SP263 assay. A robust 
high-performance DL model for automated tumor detection was devised with an 
accuracy and specificity of 0.9326 and 0.9641, respectively, and a concrete TPS 
value was obtained after tumor cell segmentation. The TPS comparison test in the 
22c3 assay showed strong consistency between the TPS calculated with the AI 
system and trained pathologists (R = 0.9429-0.9458). AI-assisted diagnosis test 
confirmed that the repeatability and efficiency of untrained pathologists could 
be improved using the AI system. The Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) assay showed high 
consistency in TPS calculations between the AI system and pathologists 
(R = 0.9787). In conclusion, a high-precision AI system is proposed for the 
automated TPS assessment of PD-L1 expression in the 22c3 and SP263 assays in 
NSCLC. Our study also indicates the benefits of using an AI-assisted system to 
improve diagnostic repeatability and efficiency for pathologists.

Here, the authors reason that the complexity of medical problems and proteome 
science might be tackled effectively with deep learning (DL) technology. 
However, deployment of DL for proteomics data requires the acquisition of data 
sets from a large number of samples. Based on the success of DL in medical 
imaging classification, proteome data from thousands of samples are arguably the 
minimal input for DL. Contemporary proteomics is turning high-throughput thanks 
to the rapid progresses of sample preparation and liquid chromatography mass 
spectrometry methods. In particular, data-independent acquisition now enables 
the generation of hundreds to thousands of quantitative proteome maps from 
clinical specimens in clinical cohorts with only limited sample amounts in 
clinical cohorts. Upheavals in the design of large-scale clinical proteomics 
studies might be required to generate proteomic big data and deploy DL to tackle 
complex medical problems.

AIM: To discuss ethical issues related to a complex study (PROFID) involving the 
development of a new, partly artificial intelligence-based, prediction model to 
enable personalised decision-making about the implantation of an implantable 
cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in postmyocardial infarction patients, and a 
parallel non-inferiority and superiority trial to test decision-making informed 
by that model.
METHOD: The position expressed in this paper is based on an analysis of the 
PROFID trials using concepts from high-profile publications in the ethical 
literature.
RESULTS: We identify ethical issues related to the testing of the model in the 
treatment setting, and to both the superiority and the non-inferiority trial. We 
underline the need for ethical-empirical studies about these issues, also among 
patients, as a parallel to the actual trials. The number of ethics committees 
involved is an organisational, but also an ethical challenge.
CONCLUSION: The PROFID trials, and probably other studies of similar scale and 
complexity, raise questions that deserve dedicated parallel ethics and social 
science research, but do not constitute a generic obstacle. A harmonisation 
procedure, comparable to the Voluntary Harmonization Procedure (VHP) for 
medication trials, could be needed for this type of trials.

Machine learning methods, combined with large electronic health databases, could 
enable a personalised approach to medicine through improved diagnosis and 
prediction of individual responses to therapies. If successful, this strategy 
would represent a revolution in clinical research and practice. However, 
although the vision of individually tailored medicine is alluring, there is a 
need to distinguish genuine potential from hype. We argue that the goal of 
personalised medical care faces serious challenges, many of which cannot be 
addressed through algorithmic complexity, and call for collaboration between 
traditional methodologists and experts in medical machine learning to avoid 
extensive research waste.

There has been much interest in the potential for machine learning and 
artificial intelligence to enhance health care. In this article, we discuss the 
potential applications of the technology to child and adolescent mental health 
services (CAMHS). We also outline the four key criteria that are likely to be 
necessary for automated prediction to be translated into clinical benefit. These 
relate to the choice of task to be automated, the nature of the available data, 
the methods applied and the context of the system to be implemented.

BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular disease, in particular stroke, is a major public 
health challenge. An important biomarker is cerebral hemodynamics. To measure 
and quantify cerebral hemodynamics, however, only invasive, potentially harmful 
or time-to-treatment prolonging methods are available.
RESULTS: We present a simulation-based approach which allows calculation of 
cerebral hemodynamics based on the patient-individual vessel configuration 
derived from structural vessel imaging. For this, we implemented a framework 
allowing segmentation and annotation of brain vessels from structural imaging 
followed by 0-dimensional lumped simulation modeling of cerebral hemodynamics. 
For annotation, a 3D-graphical user interface was implemented. For 
0D-simulation, we used a modified nodal analysis, which was adapted for easy 
implementation by code. The simulation enables identification of areas 
vulnerable to stroke and simulation of changes due to different systemic blood 
pressures. Moreover, sensitivity analysis was implemented allowing the live 
simulation of changes to simulate procedures and disease progression. Beyond 
presentation of the framework, we demonstrated in an exploratory analysis in 67 
patients that the simulation has a high specificity and low-to-moderate 
sensitivity to detect perfusion changes in classic perfusion imaging.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented precision medicine approach using novel biomarkers 
has the potential to make the application of harmful and complex perfusion 
methods obsolete.

Artificial intelligence developments are essential to the successful deployment 
of community-wide, MRI-driven prostate cancer diagnosis. AI systems should 
ensure that the main benefits of biopsy avoidance are delivered while 
maintaining consistent high specificities, at a range of disease prevalences. 
Since all current artificial intelligence / computer-aided detection systems for 
prostate cancer detection are experimental, multiple developmental efforts are 
still needed to bring the vision to fruition. Initial work needs to focus on 
developing systems as diagnostic supporting aids so their results can be 
integrated into the radiologists' workflow including gland and target outlining 
tasks for fusion biopsies. Developing AI systems as clinical decision-making 
tools will require greater efforts. The latter encompass larger multicentric, 
multivendor datasets where the different needs of patients stratified by 
diagnostic settings, disease prevalence, patient preference, and clinical 
setting are considered. AI-based, robust, standard operating procedures will 
increase the confidence of patients and payers, thus enabling the wider adoption 
of the MRI-directed approach for prostate cancer diagnosis. KEY POINTS: • AI 
systems need to ensure that the benefits of biopsy avoidance are delivered with 
consistent high specificities, at a range of disease prevalence. • Initial work 
has focused on developing systems as diagnostic supporting aids for outlining 
tasks, so they can be integrated into the radiologists' workflow to support 
MRI-directed biopsies. • Decision support tools require a larger body of work 
including multicentric, multivendor studies where the clinical needs, disease 
prevalence, patient preferences, and clinical setting are additionally defined.

INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cardiovascular health problem: 
it is common, chronic and incurs substantial healthcare expenditure because of 
stroke. Oral anticoagulation reduces the risk of thromboembolic stroke in those 
at higher risk; but for a number of patients, stroke is the first manifestation 
of undetected AF. There is a rationale for the early diagnosis of AF, before the 
first complication occurs, but population-based screening is not recommended. 
Previous prediction models have been limited by their data sources and 
methodologies. An accurate model that uses existing routinely collected data is 
needed to inform clinicians of patient-level risk of AF, inform national 
screening policy and highlight predictors that may be amenable to primary 
prevention.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will investigate the application of a range of deep 
learning techniques, including an adapted convolutional neural network, 
recurrent neural network and Transformer, on routinely collected primary care 
data to create a personalised model predicting the risk of new-onset AF over a 
range of time periods. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)-GOLD 
dataset will be used for derivation, and the CPRD-AURUM dataset will be used for 
external geographical validation. Both comprise a sizeable representative 
population and are linked at patient-level to secondary care databases. The 
performance of the deep learning models will be compared against classic machine 
learning and traditional statistical predictive modelling methods. We will only 
use risk factors accessible in primary care and endow the model with the ability 
to update risk prediction as it is presented with new data, to make the model 
more useful in clinical practice.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Permissions for CPRD-GOLD and CPRD-AURUM datasets were 
obtained from CPRD (ref no: 19_076). The CPRD ethical approval committee 
approved the study. The results will be submitted as a research paper for 
publication to a peer-reviewed journal and presented at peer-reviewed 
conferences.
TRIAL REGISTRATION DETAILS: A systematic review to incorporate within the 
overall project was registered on PROSPERO (registration number CRD42021245093). 
The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04657900).

GPR-based high-precision passive-support fiber ice coating detection method for 
power transmission lines.

Zhou R, Zhang Z, Yan Z, Zhai T, Xiao Z, Li L.

A novel monitoring method based on fiber Bragg grating sensor for detecting the 
ice coating on power transmission lines is proposed and demonstrated in this 
study. Sensors are installed on transmission line towers to monitor 
micrometeorological information and machine learning algorithms based on 
Gaussian processes use the real-time monitoring results to predict the ice 
thickness on the lines. The experimental results prove that the mean squared 
error and mean absolute percentage error values between the predicted and actual 
values are both less than 1%. This is the first time that only 
micrometeorological information has been used to monitor ice thickness.

BACKGROUND: To improve the care for cancer patients, personalized treatment 
including monitoring and managing Quality of life (QoL) data collection of 
patients in his/her home environment, its integration and its analysis is 
necessary. Advanced technologies have been used to develop smartphone devices to 
support cancer patients and clinicians by integrating all patient-relevant data, 
helping with Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO), side effect management, 
appointments, and nutritional support.
PURPOSE: In this review the role and challenges of using smartphone applications 
for precision oncology is discussed.
METHODS: The methodology section includes the data collection, data integration 
and predictive modelling approaches. The design, development and evaluation of 
(AI/ML) algorithms of these apps need intended purpose of these algorithms, 
description of used mepthods, validity and appropriateness of the datasets, 
design of the algorithms, evaluation, implementation of these (AI/ML) algorithms 
and post treatment monitoring.
RESULTS: Though Artificial intelligence (AI) based results showed higher 
diagnostic classification accuracy in most of the results, the advancement of 
these mobile apps technologies has a few limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: ML techniques and DL are used to discover novel biomarkers for 
early detection and diagnostics, and AI are used to accelerate drug discovery, 
exploit biomarkers to accurately match patients to clinical trials, and 
personalize cancer therapy based only on patient's own data. AI based smartphone 
apps cannot be treated as autonomous rather used as an integrative tool for 
patient-relevant data, PRO, side effect management, appointments, nutritional 
support, emotional and social support, severity of pain detection and correct 
diagnosis at higher level. It should encourage the clinicians and care givers to 
support and establish patient-physician relationships with the help of these 
apps.

INTRODUCTION: Precision medicine is focused on serving the unique needs of 
individuals. Oral and oropharyngeal cancer risk assessment identifies individual 
risk factors while providing support to reduce risk. The objective is to examine 
potential current and future strategies to broadly implement evidence-based oral 
and oropharyngeal cancer risk assessment and screening in dental practices 
throughout the United States.
METHODS: Feasible and effective oral cancer risk assessment and risk reduction 
strategies, ripe for implementation in dental practice, were identified in the 
published literature.
RESULTS: The Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral for Treatment (SBIRT) model 
is a feasible approach to assessing individual oral cancer risk and providing 
risk reducing interventions in the dental setting. HPV is a more recently 
identified risk factor that dentistry is well positioned to address. Evidence 
supporting the utilization of specific risk assessment tools and risk reduction 
strategies is summarized and future opportunities discussed.
DISCUSSION: Current knowledge of risk factors for oral and oropharyngeal cancers 
support the recommendation for dental providers to routinely assess all patients 
for risk factors, educate them about their personal level of cancer risk, and 
recommend actions to reduce relevant risk factors. Individuals ages 9-26 should 
be asked about their HPV vaccination status, educated about HPV and 
oropharyngeal cancer and receive a recommendation to get the HPV vaccination.

COVID-19 cases are exponentially increasing worldwide; however, its clinical 
phenotype remains unclear. Natural language processing (NLP) and machine 
learning approaches may yield key methods to rapidly identify individuals at a 
high risk of COVID-19 and to understand key symptoms upon clinical manifestation 
and presentation. Data on such symptoms may not be accurately synthesized into 
patient records owing to the pressing need to treat patients in overburdened 
health care settings. In this scenario, clinicians may focus on documenting 
widely reported symptoms that indicate a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, albeit 
at the expense of infrequently reported symptoms. While NLP solutions can play a 
key role in generating clinical phenotypes of COVID-19, they are limited by the 
resulting limitations in data from electronic health records (EHRs). A 
comprehensive record of clinic visits is required-audio recordings may be the 
answer. A recording of clinic visits represents a more comprehensive record of 
patient-reported symptoms. If done at scale, a combination of data from the EHR 
and recordings of clinic visits can be used to power NLP and machine learning 
models, thus rapidly generating a clinical phenotype of COVID-19. We propose the 
generation of a pipeline extending from audio or video recordings of clinic 
visits to establish a model that factors in clinical symptoms and predict 
COVID-19 incidence. With vast amounts of available data, we believe that a 
prediction model can be rapidly developed to promote the accurate screening of 
individuals at a high risk of COVID-19 and to identify patient characteristics 
that predict a greater risk of a more severe infection. If clinical encounters 
are recorded and our NLP model is adequately refined, benchtop virologic 
findings would be better informed. While clinic visit recordings are not the 
panacea for this pandemic, they are a low-cost option with many potential 
benefits, which have recently begun to be explored.

AIM: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based breast cancer grading may help to 
overcome perceived limitations of human assessment. Here, the potential value of 
AI grade was evaluated at the molecular level and in predicting patient outcome.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) model was 
trained on images of 612 breast cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The 
test set, obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN), comprised 
1058 cancers with corresponding survival data. Upon reversal, a CNN was trained 
from images of 1537 CHTN cancers and tested on 397 TCGA cancers. In TCGA, mRNA 
models were trained using AI grade and Nottingham grade (NG) as labels. 
Performance of mRNA models in predicting patient outcome was evaluated using 
data from 1807 cancers from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer 
International Consortium (METABRIC) cohort. In selecting images for training, 
nucleolar prominence determined high- versus low-grade cancer cells. In CHTN, NG 
corresponded to significant survival stratification in stages 1, 2 and 3 
cancers, while AI grade showed significance in stages 1 and 2 and borderline in 
stage 3 tumours. In METABRIC, the mRNA model trained from AI grade was not 
significantly different to the NG-based model. The gene which best described AI 
grade was TRIP13, a gene involved with mitotic spindle assembly.
CONCLUSION: An AI grade trained from the morphologically distinctive feature of 
nucleolar prominence could transmit significant patient outcome information 
across three independent patient cohorts. AI grade shows promise in gene 
discovery and for second opinions.

The human gut microbiome has received a crescendo of attention in recent years 
due to the countless influences on human pathophysiology, including cancer. 
Research on cancer and anticancer therapy is constantly looking for new hints to 
improve the response to therapy while reducing the risk of relapse. In this 
scenario, the gut microbiome and the plethora of microbial-derived metabolites 
are considered a new opening in the development of innovative anticancer 
treatments for a better prognosis. This narrative review summarizes the current 
knowledge on the role of the gut microbiome in the onset and progression of 
cancer, as well as in response to chemo-immunotherapy. Recent findings regarding 
the tumor microbiome and its implications for clinical practice are also 
commented on. Current microbiome-based intervention strategies (i.e., 
prebiotics, probiotics, live biotherapeutics and fecal microbiota 
transplantation) are then discussed, along with key shortcomings, including a 
lack of long-term safety information in patients who are already severely 
compromised by standard treatments. The implementation of bioinformatic tools 
applied to microbiomics and other omics data, such as machine learning, has an 
enormous potential to push research in the field, enabling the prediction of 
health risk and therapeutic outcomes, for a truly personalized precision 
medicine.

To date, widely generalizable artificial intelligence (AI) programs for medical 
image analysis have not been demonstrated, including for mammography. Rather 
than pursuing a strategy of collecting ever-larger databases in the attempt to 
build generalizable programs, we suggest three possible avenues for exploring a 
precision medicine or precision imaging approach. First, it is now 
technologically feasible to collect hundreds of thousands of multi-institutional 
cases along with other patient data, allowing stratification of patients into 
subpopulations that have similar characteristics in the manner discussed by the 
National Research Council in its white paper on precision medicine. A family of 
AI programs could be developed across different examination types that are 
matched to specific patient subpopulations. Such stratification can help address 
bias, including racial or ethnic bias, by allowing unbiased data aggregation for 
creation of subpopulations. Second, for common examinations, larger institutions 
may be able to collect enough of their own data to train AI programs that 
reflect disease prevalence and variety in their respective unique patient 
subpopulations. Third, high- and low-probability subpopulations can be 
identified by application of AI programs, thereby allowing their triage off the 
radiology work list. This would reduce radiologists' workloads, providing more 
time for interpretation of the remaining examinations. For high-volume 
procedures, investigators should come together to define reference standards, 
collect data, and compare the merits of pursuing generalizability versus a 
precision medicine subpopulation-based strategy.

Drug repurposing refers to the identification of clinically approved drugs with 
the known safety profiles and defined pharmacokinetic properties for new 
indications. Despite the advances in oncology research, cancers are still 
associated with the most unmet medical needs. Drug repurposing has emerged as a 
useful approach for the search for effective and durable cancer treatment. It 
may also represent a promising strategy to facilitate precision cancer treatment 
and overcome drug resistance. The repurposing of non-cancer drugs for precision 
oncology effectively extends the inventory of actionable molecular targets and 
thus increases the number of patients who may benefit from precision cancer 
treatment. In cancer types where genetic heterogeneity is so high that it is not 
feasible to identify strong repurposed drug candidates for standard treatment, 
the precision oncology approach offers individual patients access to novel 
treatment options. For repurposed candidates with low potency, a combination of 
multiple repurposed drugs may produce a synergistic therapeutic effect. 
Precautions should be taken when combining repurposed drugs with anticancer 
agents to avoid detrimental drug-drug interactions and unwanted side effects. 
New multifactorial data analysis and artificial intelligence methods are needed 
to untangle the complex association of molecular signatures influencing specific 
cancer subtypes to facilitate drug repurposing in precision oncology.

Binswanger disease is the small vessel form of vascular cognitive impairment and 
dementia. Deposition of Alzheimer disease proteins can begin in midlife and 
progress slowly, whereas aging of the vasculature also can begin in midlife, 
continuing to progress into old age, making mixed dementia the most common type 
of dementia. Biomarkers facilitate the early diagnosis of dementias. It is 
possible to diagnose mixed dementia before autopsy with biomarkers for vascular 
disease derived from diffusor tensor images on magnetic resonance imaging and 
Alzheimer disease proteins, Aβ (amyloid β), and phosphorylated tau, in 
cerebrospinal fluid or in brain with positron emission tomography. The presence 
of vascular disease accelerates cognitive decline. Both misfolded proteins and 
vascular disease promote inflammation, which can be detected in cerebrospinal 
fluid by the presence of MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases), angiogenic growth 
factors, and cytokines. MMPs disrupt the blood-brain barrier and break down 
myelin, producing Binswanger disease's 2 main pathological features. Advances in 
detecting biomarkers in plasma will provide early detection of dementia and 
aided by machine learning and artificial intelligence, will enhance diagnosis 
and form the basis for early treatments.

We introduce the Transcriptome State Perturbation Generator (TSPG) as a novel 
deep-learning method to identify changes in genomic expression that occur 
between tissue states using generative adversarial networks. TSPG learns the 
transcriptome perturbations from RNA-sequencing data required to shift from a 
source to a target class. We apply TSPG as an effective method of detecting 
biologically relevant alternate expression patterns between normal and tumor 
human tissue samples. We demonstrate that the application of TSPG to expression 
data obtained from a biopsy sample of a patient's kidney cancer can identify 
patient-specific differentially expressed genes between their individual tumor 
sample and a target class of healthy kidney gene expression. By utilizing TSPG 
in a precision medicine application in which the patient sample is not 
replicated (i.e., n = 1 ), we present a novel technique of determining 
significant transcriptional aberrations that can be used to help identify 
potential targeted therapies.

Here, we have constructed neural network-based models that predict atomic 
partial charges with high accuracy at low computational cost. The models were 
trained using high-quality data acquired from quantum mechanics calculations 
using the fragment molecular orbital method. We have succeeded in obtaining 
highly accurate atomic partial charges for three representative molecular 
systems of proteins, including one large biomolecule (approx. 2000 atoms). The 
novelty of our approach is the ability to take into account the electronic 
polarization in the system, which is a system-dependent phenomenon, being 
important in the field of drug design. Our high-precision models are useful for 
the prediction of atomic partial charges and expected to be widely applicable in 
structure-based drug designs such as structural optimization, high-speed and 
high-precision docking, and molecular dynamics calculations.

Genotype plays a significant role in determining characteristics in an organism 
and genotype calling has been greatly accelerated by sequencing technologies. 
Furthermore, most parametric statistical models are unable to effectively call 
genotype, which is influenced by the size of structural variations and the 
coverage fluctuations of sequencing data. In this study, we propose a new method 
for calling deletions' genotypes from the next-generation data, called Cnngeno. 
Cnngeno can convert sequencing data into images and classifies the genotypes 
from these images using the convolutional neural network(CNN). Moreover, Cnngeno 
adopted the convolutional bootstrapping strategy to improve the anti-noisy 
label's ability. The results show that Cnngeno performs better in terms of 
precision for calling genotype when compared with other existing methods. The 
Cnngeno is an open-source method, available at 
https://github.com/BRF123/Cnngeno.

Recent studies have shown that RNA methylation modification can affect RNA 
transcription, metabolism, splicing and stability. In addition, RNA methylation 
modification has been associated with cancer, obesity and other diseases. Based 
on information about human genome and machine learning, this paper discusses the 
effect of the fusion sequence and gene-level feature extraction on the accuracy 
of methylation site recognition. The significant limitation of existing 
computing tools was exposed by discovered of new features. (1) Most prediction 
models are based solely on sequence features and use SVM or random forest as 
classification methods. (2) Limited by the number of samples, the model may not 
achieve good performance. In order to establish a better prediction model for 
methylation sites, we must set specific weighting strategies for training 
samples and find more powerful and informative feature matrices to establish a 
comprehensive model. In this paper, we present HSM6AP, a high-precision 
predictor for the Homo sapiens N6-methyladenosine (m6A) based on multiple 
weights and feature stitching. Compared with existing methods, HSM6AP samples 
were creatively weighted during training, and a wide range of features were 
explored. Max-Relevance-Max-Distance (MRMD) is employed for feature selection, 
and the feature matrix is generated by fusing a single feature. The extreme 
gradient boosting (XGBoost), an integrated machine learning algorithm based on 
decision tree, is used for model training and improves model performance through 
parameter adjustment. Two rigorous independent data sets demonstrated the 
superiority of HSM6AP in identifying methylation sites. HSM6AP is an advanced 
predictor that can be directly employed by users (especially non-professional 
users) to predict methylation sites. Users can access our related tools and data 
sets at the following website: http://lab.malab.cn/~lijing/HSM6AP.html The codes 
of our tool can be publicly accessible at

Renal cell cancer (RCC) is a heterogeneous tumor that shows both intra- and 
inter-heterogeneity. Heterogeneity is displayed not only in different patients 
but also among RCC cells in the same tumor, which makes treatment difficult 
because of varying degrees of responses generated in RCC heterogeneous tumor 
cells even with targeted treatment. In that context, precision medicine (PM), in 
terms of individualized treatment catered for a specific patient or groups of 
patients, can shift the paradigm of treatment in the clinical management of RCC. 
Recent progress in the biochemical, molecular, and histological characteristics 
of RCC has thrown light on many deregulated pathways involved in the 
pathogenesis of RCC. As PM-based therapies are rapidly evolving and few are 
already in current clinical practice in oncology, one can expect that PM will 
expand its way toward the robust treatment of patients with RCC. This article 
provides a comprehensive background on recent strategies and breakthroughs of PM 
in oncology and provides an overview of the potential applicability of PM in 
RCC. The article also highlights the drawbacks of PM and provides a holistic 
approach that goes beyond the involvement of clinicians and encompasses 
appropriate legislative and administrative care imparted by the healthcare 
system and insurance providers. It is anticipated that combined efforts from all 
sectors involved will make PM accessible to RCC and other patients with cancer, 
making a tremendous positive leap on individualized treatment strategies. This 
will subsequently enhance the quality of life of patients.

INTRODUCTION: Meeting ambitious global health goals with limited resources 
requires a precision public health (PxPH) approach. Here we describe how 
integrating data collection optimisation, traditional analytics and causal 
artificial intelligence/machine learning (ML) can be used in a use case for 
increasing hospital deliveries of newborns in Uttar Pradesh, India.
METHODS: Using a systematic behavioural framework we designed a large-scale 
survey on perceptual, interpersonal and structural drivers of women's behaviour 
around childbirth (n=5613). Multivariate logistic regression identified factors 
associated with institutional delivery (ID). Causal ML determined the 
cause-and-effect ordering of these factors. Variance decomposition was used to 
parse sources of variation in delivery location, and a supervised learning 
algorithm was used to distinguish population subgroups.
RESULTS: Among the factors found associated with ID, the causal model showed 
that having a delivery plan (OR=6.1, 95% CI 6.0 to 6.3), believing the hospital 
is safer than home (OR=5.4, 95% CI 5.1 to 5.6) and awareness of financial 
incentives were direct causes of ID (OR=3.4, 95% CI 3.3 to 3.5). Distance to the 
hospital, borrowing delivery money and the primary decision-maker were not 
causal. Individual-level factors contributed 69% of variance in delivery 
location. The segmentation analysis showed four distinct subgroups 
differentiated by ID risk perception, parity and planning.
CONCLUSION: These findings generate a holistic picture of the drivers and 
barriers to ID in Uttar Pradesh and suggest distinct intervention points for 
different women. This demonstrates data optimised to identify key behavioural 
drivers, coupled with traditional and ML analytics, can help design a PxPH 
approach that maximise the impact of limited resources.

Precision medicine informatics is a field of research that incorporates learning 
systems that generate new knowledge to improve individualized treatments using 
integrated data sets and models. Given the ever-increasing volumes of data that 
are relevant to patient care, artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines need to be 
a central component of such research to speed discovery. Applying AI methodology 
to complex multidisciplinary information retrieval can support efforts to 
discover bridging concepts within collaborating communities. This dovetails with 
precision medicine research, given the information rich multi-omic data that are 
used in precision medicine analysis pipelines. In this perspective article we 
define a prototype AI pipeline to facilitate discovering research connections 
between bioinformatics and clinical researchers. We propose building knowledge 
representations that are iteratively improved through AI and human-informed 
learning feedback loops supported through crowdsourcing. To illustrate this, we 
will explore the specific use case of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a 
growing health care problem. We will examine AI pipeline construction and 
utilization in relation to bench-to-bedside bridging concepts with 
interconnecting knowledge representations applicable to bioinformatics 
researchers and clinicians.

Image-based drug testing in patient biopsies has recently been shown to identify 
potent treatments for patients suffering from relapsed or refractory 
hematological cancers. Here we investigate the use of weakly-supervised deep 
learning on cell morphologies (DML) to complement immunofluorescence (IF) in the 
classification of cancer and healthy cells in such drug testing. Across 390 
biopsies from 289 patients with diverse blood cancers, DML-based drug responses 
show improved reproducibility and clustering of drugs with the same mode of 
action. DML does so by adapting to batch effects and by autonomously recognizing 
disease-associated cell morphologies. In a post-hoc analysis of 66 patients, 
DML-recommended treatments led to improved progression free survival compared to 
IF-based recommendations and physician's choice-based treatments. Treatments 
recommended by both IF and DML enriched for patients achieving exceptional 
clinical responses. Thus, DML-enhanced ex vivo drug screening is a promising new 
tool in the identification of effective personalized treatments.

Recently, a novel knowledge bank (KB) approach to predict outcomes of individual 
patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was developed using unbiased machine 
learning. To validate its prognostic value, we analyzed 1612 adults with de novo 
AML treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B front-line trials who had 
pretreatment clinical, cytogenetics, and mutation data on 81 
leukemia/cancer-associated genes available. We used receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) to evaluate the 
predictive values of the KB algorithm and other risk classifications. The KB 
algorithm predicted 3-year overall survival (OS) probability in the entire 
patient cohort (AUCKB = 0.799), and both younger (< 60 years) (AUCKB = 0.747) 
and older patients (AUCKB = 0.770). The KB algorithm predicted non-remission 
death (AUCKB = 0.860) well but was less accurate in predicting relapse death 
(AUCKB = 0.695) and death in first complete remission (AUCKB = 0.603). The KB 
algorithm's 3-year OS predictive value was higher than that of the 2017 European 
LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification (AUC2017ELN = 0.707, p < 0.001) and 2010 ELN 
classification (AUC2010ELN = 0.721, p < 0.001) but did not differ significantly 
from that of the 17-gene stemness score (AUC17-gene = 0.732, p = 0.10). Analysis 
of additional cytogenetic and molecular markers not included in the KB algorithm 
revealed that taking into account atypical complex karyotype, infrequent 
recurrent balanced chromosome rearrangements and mutational status of the 
SAMHD1, AXL and NOTCH1 genes may improve the KB algorithm. We conclude that the 
KB algorithm has a high predictive value that is higher than those of the 2017 
and 2010 ELN classifications. Inclusion of additional genetic features might 
refine the KB algorithm.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence tool 
to assess echocardiographic image quality objectively.
BACKGROUND: Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) has recently 
been used to monitor cancer therapeutics-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) but 
image quality limits its reliability.
METHODS: A DenseNet-121 convolutional neural network was developed for view 
identification from an athlete's echocardiographic dataset. To prove the concept 
that classification confidence (CC) can serve as a quality marker, values of 
longitudinal strain derived from feature tracking of cardiac magnetic resonance 
(CMR) imaging and strain analysis of echocardiography were compared. The CC was 
then applied to patients with breast cancer free from CTRCD to investigate the 
effects of image quality on the reliability of strain analysis.
RESULTS: CC of the apical 4-chamber view (A4C) was significantly correlated with 
the endocardial border delineation index. CC of A4C >900 significantly predicted 
a <15% relative difference in longitudinal strain between CMR feature tracking 
and automated echocardiographic analysis. Echocardiographic studies (n =752) of 
102 patients with breast cancer without CTRCD were investigated. The strain 
analysis showed higher parallel forms, inter-rater, and test-retest 
reliabilities in patients with CC of A4C >900. During sequential comparisons of 
automated LVGLS in individual patients, those with CC of A4C >900 had a lower 
false positive detection rate of CTRCD.
CONCLUSIONS: CC of A4C was associated with the reliability of automated LVGLS 
and could also potentially be used as a filter to select comparable images from 
sequential echocardiographic studies in individual patients and reduce the 
false positive detection rate of CTRCD.

A current trend in automotive research is autonomous driving. For the proper 
testing and validation of automated driving functions a reference vehicle state 
is required. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are useful in the 
automation of the vehicles because of their practicality and accuracy. However, 
there are situations where the satellite signal is absent or unusable. This 
research work presents a methodology that addresses those situations, thus 
largely reducing the dependency of Inertial Navigation Systems (INSs) on the 
SatNav. The proposed methodology includes (1) a standstill recognition based on 
machine learning, (2) a detailed mathematical description of the horizontation 
of inertial measurements, (3) sensor fusion by means of statistical filtering, 
(4) an outlier detection for correction data, (5) a drift detector, and (6) a 
novel LiDAR-based Positioning Method (LbPM) for indoor navigation. The 
robustness and accuracy of the methodology are validated with a state-of-the-art 
INS with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) correction data. The results obtained show a 
great improvement in the accuracy of vehicle state estimation under adverse 
driving conditions, such as when the correction data is corrupted, when there 
are extended periods with no correction data and in the case of drifting. The 
proposed LbPM method achieves an accuracy closely resembling that of a system 
with RTK.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes reversal has been viewed in the literature primarily 
as a dichotomous event (reversed or not reversed), even though this viewpoint 
may not be optimal for clinicians or patients. This cohort study's objectives 
were to define stages of type 2 diabetes reversal and measure changes in 
reversal stages before and after 90 days of digital twin-enabled precision 
nutrition therapy.
METHODS: This study defines seven stages of diabetes reversal. The study is a 
retrospective pre/post comparison of changes in reversal stage, hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c), weight, body mass index (BMI), and other metrics measured before and 
after precision nutrition therapy. Reversal stages were defined as Stage 0: 
HbA1c < 5.7% without medication for > 1 year, Stage 1: HbA1c < 5.7% without 
medication for < 1 year, Stage 2: HbA1c < 6.5% without medication, Stage 3: 
estimated HbA1c (eA1c) between 5.7 and 6.4% without medication, Stage 4: 
estimated HbA1c (eA1c) between 5.7 and 6.4% with metformin monotherapy, Stage 5: 
dual oral therapy, Stage 6: > = 3 medications.
RESULTS: Reversal stage information was available for 463 patients at baseline 
and 90 days. At baseline, the proportions of patients in each reversal stage 
were Stages 1 and 2: 0%, Stage 3: 1%, Stage 4: 8%, Stage 5: 6%, and Stage 6: 
85%. After 90 days, the proportions in each reversal stage were Stage 1: 2%, 
Stage 2: 9%, Stage 3: 32%, Stage 4: 39%, Stage 5: 7%, and Stage 6: 11%, 
indicating significant progress. Reversal stage progression rates varied by 
patient subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes patients reached differing reversal stages during 
90 days of precision nutrition therapy. Use of reversal stages may benefit 
patients during therapy.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This was a retrospective study that was approved by the 
Medisys Clinisearch Ethical Review Board (without registration number) in 2019.

Plants are often attacked by various pathogens during their growth, which may 
cause environmental pollution, food shortages, or economic losses in a certain 
area. Integration of high throughput phenomics data and computer vision (CV) 
provides a great opportunity to realize plant disease diagnosis in the early 
stage and uncover the subtype or stage patterns in the disease progression. In 
this study, we proposed a novel computational framework for plant disease 
identification and subtype discovery through a deep-embedding image-clustering 
strategy, Weighted Distance Metric and the t-stochastic neighbor embedding 
algorithm (WDM-tSNE). To verify the effectiveness, we applied our method on four 
public datasets of images. The results demonstrated that the newly developed 
tool is capable of identifying the plant disease and further uncover the 
underlying subtypes associated with pathogenic resistance. In summary, the 
current framework provides great clustering performance for the root or leave 
images of diseased plants with pronounced disease spots or symptoms.

Although traditional approaches to biomarker discovery have elucidated key 
molecular markers that have improved drug selection (precision medicine), the 
discovery of biomarkers that inform optimal dose selection (precision dosing) 
continues to be a challenge in many therapeutic areas. Larger and more diverse 
study populations are necessary to discover additional biomarkers that provide 
the resolution needed for a more tailored dose. To generate and accommodate 
large datasets of drug response phenotypes, time- and cost-efficient strategies 
are necessary. In particular, a multitude of technological advances that 
originated for purposes outside of biomedical research (electronic health 
records, direct-to-consumer genetic testing, social media, mobile devices, and 
machine learning) have made it easier to communicate, connect, and gather 
information from consumers. Although these technologies have been used with 
success in the health sciences for an array of purposes, these resources have 
not been fully capitalized on for precision dosing. This perspective will touch 
on how these innovations can be used as data sources, data collection tools, and 
data processing tools for drug-response phenotypes with a unique focus on 
advancing biomarker-driven precision dosing.

We have recently demonstrated supervised deep learning methods for rapid 
generation of radiofrequency pulses in magnetic resonance imaging 
(https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.27740, https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.28667). Unlike 
the previous iterative optimization approaches, deep learning methods generate a 
pulse using a fixed number of floating-point operations - this is important in 
MRI, where patient-specific pulses preferably must be produced in real time. 
However, deep learning requires vast training libraries, which must be generated 
using the traditional methods, e.g., iterative quantum optimal control methods. 
Those methods are usually variations of gradient descent, and the calculation of 
the gradient of the performance metric with respect to the pulse waveform can be 
the most numerically intensive step. In this communication, we explore various 
ways in which the calculation of gradients in quantum optimal control theory may 
be accelerated. Four optimization avenues are explored: truncated commutator 
series expansions at zeroth and first order, a novel midpoint truncation scheme 
at first order, and the exact complex-step method. For the spin systems relevant 
to MRI, the first-order midpoint truncation is found to be sufficiently 
accurate, but also significantly faster than the machine precision gradient. 
This makes the generation of training databases for the machine learning methods 
considerably more realistic.

The number of interconnected devices, such as personal wearables, cars, and 
smart-homes, surrounding us every day has recently increased. The Internet of 
Things devices monitor many processes, and have the capacity of using machine 
learning models for pattern recognition, and even making decisions, with the 
added advantage of diminishing network congestion by allowing computations near 
to the data sources. The main restriction is the low computation capacity of 
these devices. Thus, machine learning algorithms capable of maintaining accuracy 
while using mechanisms that exploit certain characteristics, such as 
low-precision versions, are needed. In this paper, low-precision mutual 
information-based feature selection algorithms are employed over DNA microarray 
datasets, showing that 16-bit and some times even 8-bit representations of these 
algorithms can be used without significant variations in the final 
classification results achieved. Graphical Abstract Graphical abstract.

To improve long-term outcomes of therapies for chronic diseases, health 
promotion and lifestyle modifications are the most promising and sustainable 
strategies. In addition, advances in digital technologies provide new 
opportunities to address limitations of drug-based treatments, such as 
medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, drug resistance, drug 
shortages, affordability, and accessibility. Pharmaceutical drugs and biologics 
can be combined with digital health technologies, including mobile medical apps 
(digital therapeutics), which offer additional clinical benefits and 
cost-effectiveness. Promises of drug+digital combination therapies are 
recognized by pharmaceutical and digital health companies, opening opportunities 
for integrating pharmacotherapies with non-pharmacological interventions 
(metapharmacology). Herein we present unique features of digital health 
technologies which can deliver personalized self-care modalities such as 
breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, yoga, physical activity, adequate 
sleep, listening to preferred music, forgiveness and gratitude. Clinical studies 
reveal how aforementioned complimentary practices may support treatments of 
epilepsy, chronic pain, depression, cancer, and other chronic diseases. This 
article also describes how digital therapies delivering "medicinal" self-care 
and other non-pharmacological interventions can also be personalized by 
accounting for: 1) genetic risks for comorbidities, 2) adverse childhood 
experiences, 3) increased risks for viral infections such as seasonal influenza, 
or COVID-19, and 4) just-in-time stressful and traumatic circumstances. 
Development and implementation of personalized pharmacological-behavioral 
combination therapies (precision metapharmacology) require aligning priorities 
of key stakeholders including patients, research communities, healthcare 
industry, regulatory and funding agencies. In conclusion, digital technologies 
enable integration of pharmacotherapies with self-care, lifestyle interventions 
and patient empowerment, while concurrently advancing patient-centered care, 
integrative medicine and digital health ecosystems.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to examine changes in hemoglobin 
A1c (HbA1c), anti-diabetic medication use, insulin resistance, and other 
ambulatory glucose profile metrics between baseline and after 90 days of 
participation in the Twin Precision Nutrition (TPN) Program enabled by Digital 
Twin Technology.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with type 2 diabetes who 
participated in the TPN Program and had at least 3 months of follow-up. The TPN 
machine learning algorithm used daily continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and food 
intake data to provide guidelines that would enable individual patients to avoid 
foods that cause blood glucose spikes and to replace them with foods that do not 
produce spikes. Physicians with access to daily CGM data titrated medications 
and monitored patient conditions.
RESULTS: Of the 89 patients who initially enrolled in the TPN Program, 64 
patients remained in the program and adhered to it for at least 90 days; all 
analyses were performed on these 64 patients. At the 90-day follow-up 
assessment, mean (± standard deviation) HbA1c had decreased from 8.8 ± 2.2% at 
baseline by 1.9 to 6.9 ± 1.1%, mean weight had decreased from 79.0 ± 16.2 kg at 
baseline to 74.2 ± 14.7 kg, and mean fasting blood glucose had fallen from 
151.2 ± 45.0 mg/dl at baseline to 129.1 ± 36.7 mg/dl. Homeostatic model 
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) had decreased by 56.9% from 7.4 ± 3.5 
to 3.2 ± 2.8. At the 90-day follow-up assessment, all 12 patients who were on 
insulin had stopped taking this medication; 38 of the 56 patients taking 
metformin had stopped metformin; 26 of the 28 patients on dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
(DPP-4) inhibitors discontinued DPP-4 inhibitors; all 13 patients on 
alpha-glucosidase inhibitors discontinued these inhibitors; all 34 patients on 
sulfonylureas were able to stop taking these medications; two patients stopped 
taking pioglitazone; all ten patients on sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitors stopped taking SGLT2 inhibitors; and one patient stopped taking 
glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues.
CONCLUSION: The results provide evidence that daily precision nutrition guidance 
based on CGM, food intake data, and machine learning algorithms can benefit 
patients with type 2 diabetes. Adherence for 3 months to the TPN Program 
resulted in patients achieving a 1.9 percentage point decrease in HbA1c, a 6.1% 
drop in weight, a 56.9% reduction in HOMA-IR, a significant decline in glucose 
time below range, and, in most patients, the elimination of diabetes medication 
use.

Precision medicine is a new approach to understanding health and disease based 
on patient-specific data such as medical diagnoses; clinical phenotype; biologic 
investigations such as laboratory studies and imaging; and environmental, 
demographic, and lifestyle factors. The importance of machine learning 
techniques in healthcare has expanded quickly in the last decade owing to the 
rising availability of vast multi-modality data and developed computational 
models and algorithms. Reinforcement learning is an appealing method for 
developing efficient policies in various healthcare areas where the 
decision-making process is typically defined by a long period or a sequential 
process. In our research, we leverage the power of reinforcement learning and 
electronic health records of South Koreans to dynamically recommend treatment 
prescriptions, which are personalized based on patient information of 
hypertension. Our proposed reinforcement learning-based treatment recommendation 
system decides whether to use mono, dual, or triple therapy according to the 
state of the hypertension patients. We evaluated the performance of our 
personalized treatment recommendation model by lowering the occurrence of 
hypertension-related complications and blood pressure levels of patients who 
followed our model's recommendation. With our findings, we believe that our 
proposed hypertension treatment recommendation model could assist doctors in 
prescribing appropriate antihypertensive medications.

Recent applications of artificial intelligence have shown great promise for 
improving the quality and efficiency of clinical care. Numerous clinical 
decision support tools exist in today's electronic health records (EHRs) such as 
medication dosing support, order facilitators (eg, procedure specific order 
sets), and point of care alerts. However, less has been done to integrate 
artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled risk predictors into EHRs despite wide 
availability of validated risk prediction tools. An interoperability standard 
known as SMART on FHIR (substitutable medical applications and reusable 
technologies on fast health interoperability resources) offers a promising path 
forward, enabling digital innovations to be seamlessly integrated with the EHR 
with regard to the user interface and patient data. For the next step in 
progress towards the goal of learning healthcare and informatics-enabled spine 
surgery, we propose the application of SMART on FHIR to integrate existing and 
new risk predictions tools in spine surgery through an EHR add-on-application.

Protein stability predictions are becoming essential in medicine to develop 
novel immunotherapeutic agents and for drug discovery. Despite the large number 
of computational approaches for predicting the protein stability upon mutation, 
there are still critical unsolved problems: 1) the limited number of 
thermodynamic measurements for proteins provided by current databases; 2) the 
large intrinsic variability of ΔΔG values due to different experimental 
conditions; 3) biases in the development of predictive methods caused by 
ignoring the anti-symmetry of ΔΔG values between mutant and native protein 
forms; 4) over-optimistic prediction performance, due to sequence similarity 
between proteins used in training and test datasets. Here, we review these 
issues, highlighting new challenges required to improve current tools and to 
achieve more reliable predictions. In addition, we provide a perspective of how 
these methods will be beneficial for designing novel precision medicine 
approaches for several genetic disorders caused by mutations, such as cancer and 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Future precision medicine will be undoubtedly sustained by the detection of 
validated biomarkers that enable a precise classification of patients based on 
their predicted disease risk, prognosis, and response to a specific treatment. 
Up to now, genomics, transcriptomics, and immunohistochemistry have been the 
main clinically amenable tools at hand for identifying key diagnostic, 
prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. However, other molecular strategies, 
including metabolomics, are still in their infancy and require the development 
of new biomarker detection technologies, toward routine implementation into 
clinical diagnosis. In this context, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) 
spectroscopy has been recognized as a promising technology for clinical 
monitoring thanks to its high sensitivity and label-free operation, which should 
help accelerate the discovery of biomarkers and their corresponding screening in 
a simpler, faster, and less-expensive manner. Many studies have demonstrated the 
excellent performance of SERS in biomedical applications. However, such studies 
have also revealed several variables that should be considered for accurate SERS 
monitoring, in particular, when the signal is collected from biological sources 
(tissues, cells or biofluids). This Perspective is aimed at piecing together the 
puzzle of SERS in biomarker monitoring, with a view on future challenges and 
implications. We address the most relevant requirements of plasmonic substrates 
for biomedical applications, as well as the implementation of tools from 
artificial intelligence or biotechnology to guide the development of highly 
versatile sensors.

Bladder cancer (BC) is the most common urinary malignancy; however accurate 
diagnosis and prediction of recurrence after therapies remain elusive. This 
study aimed to develop a biosignature of immunotherapy-based responses using 
gene expression data. Publicly available BC datasets were collected, and machine 
learning (ML) approaches were applied to identify a novel biosignature to 
differentiate patient subgroups. Immune phenotyping of BC in the IMvigor210 
dataset included three subtypes: inflamed, excluded, and desert immune. Immune 
phenotypes were analyzed with gene expressions using traditional but powerful 
classification methods such as random forests, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), 
Support Vector Machines (SVM) together with boosting and feature selection 
methods. Specifically, DNN yielded the highest area under the curve (AUC) with 
precision and recall (PR) curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves for each phenotype ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], 
respectively) resulting in the identification of gene expression features useful 
for immune phenotype classification. Our results suggest significant potential 
to further develop and utilize machine learning algorithms for analysis of BC 
and its precaution. In conclusion, the findings from this study present a novel 
gene expression assay that can accurately discriminate BC patients from 
controls. Upon further validation in independent cohorts, this gene signature 
could be developed into a predictive test that can support clinical evaluation 
and patient care.

In the last few decades, great epidemiological studies identified the main risk 
factors and their causative role in cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In this 
field, the pivotal study was the Framingham Heart Study for the evaluation of 
classical risk factors and for the production of initial instruments of risk 
calculation. The Seven Countries Study of Cardiovascular Diseases was the first 
to compare the influence of different cultural environments on the risks of 
developing atherosclerosis. In 1980, the Italian Journal of Cardiology published 
an extensive evaluation of risk factors in nine Italian communities. Since the 
early '90s, the first risk charts for global and individual risk evaluation were 
available (Framingham, SCORE, PROCAM, CUORE). Mortality reduction in the period 
of 1980-2000 can be attributed to risk factor reduction in primary prevention 
(55%) and to pharmacological treatment in the acute phase of the disease or in 
secondary prevention (40%). Two important longitudinal studies have been 
conducted in Italy in the periods of 1998-2002 and 2008-2012 thanks to the 
cooperation of the National Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO) and 
the National Health Institute (ISS), which became the reference point for the 
influence of lifestyle and risk factors on CVD. During the last 15 years, 
genetic studies allowed the construction of polygenic risk scores (PRS), that 
are strongly predictive of developing CVD in the future, thanks to big genomic 
datasets of individuals followed for more than 10 years (e.g. UK Biobank). PRS 
can be used as an adjunctive tool to the common risk charts for a better 
classification of individual risk profile. In addition to PRS, inflammation 
biomarkers and imaging tools like ultrasound and coronary calcium score and 
their integration with machine learning can help in the best definition of 
cardiovascular risk. Precision prevention by the study of "metabotypes" and 
community prevention provide possible future development of cardiovascular 
prevention.

Camera calibration is the most important aspect of computer vision research. To 
address the issue of insufficient precision, therefore, a high precision 
calibration algorithm for binocular stereo vision camera using deep 
reinforcement learning is proposed. Firstly, a binocular stereo camera model is 
established. Camera calibration is mainly divided into internal and external 
parameter calibration. Secondly, the internal parameter calibration is completed 
by solving the antihidden point of the camera light center and the camera 
distortion value of the camera plane. The deep learning fitting value function 
is used based on the internal parameters. The target network is established to 
adjust the parameters of the value function, and the convergence of the value 
function is calculated to optimize reinforcement learning. The deep 
reinforcement learning fitting structure is built, the camera data is entered, 
and the external parameter calibration is finished by continuous updating and 
convergence. Finally, the high precision calibration of the binocular stereo 
vision camera is completed. The results show that the calibration error of the 
proposed algorithm under different sizes of checkerboard calibration board test 
is only 0.36% and 0.35%, respectively, the calibration accuracy is high, the 
value function converges quickly, and the parameter calculation accuracy is 
high, the overall time consumption of the proposed algorithm is short, and the 
calibration results have strong stability.

Stress appears as a response for a broad variety of physiological stimuli. It 
does vary among individuals in amplitude, phase and frequency. Thus, the 
necessity for personalised diagnosis is key to prevent stress-related diseases. 
In order to evaluate stress levels, a multi-sensing system is proposed based on 
non-invasive EEG and ECG signals. A target population of 24 individuals which 
age range between 18-23 years old are intentionally exposed to control-induced 
stress tests while EEG and ECG are simultaneously recorded. The acquired signals 
are processed by using semisupevised Machine Learning techniques as those 
provide a patient-specific approach due to key characteristics such as 
adaptiveness and robustness. In here, a stress metric is proposed that jointly 
with each individual medical history provide mechanisms to prevent and avoid 
possible chronic-health issues for individuals whom are more sensitive to 
stressors. Finally, supervised learning techniques are used to classify the 
obtained featured clusters to evaluate specific and general subject models in 
order to pave the way for real time stress monitoring.

BACKGROUND: Predicting neurological recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is 
challenging. Using topological data analysis, we have previously shown that mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) during SCI surgery predicts long-term functional 
recovery in rodent models, motivating the present multicenter study in patients.
METHODS: Intra-operative monitoring records and neurological outcome data were 
extracted (n = 118 patients). We built a similarity network of patients from a 
low-dimensional space embedded using a non-linear algorithm, Isomap, and ensured 
topological extraction using persistent homology metrics. Confirmatory analysis 
was conducted through regression methods.
RESULTS: Network analysis suggested that time outside of an optimum MAP range 
(hypotension or hypertension) during surgery was associated with lower 
likelihood of neurological recovery at hospital discharge. Logistic and LASSO 
(least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression confirmed these 
findings, revealing an optimal MAP range of 76-[104-117] mmHg associated with 
neurological recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that deviation from this optimal MAP range during SCI 
surgery predicts lower probability of neurological recovery and suggest new 
targets for therapeutic intervention.

Plain Language Summary: Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition that 
involves damage to the nerve fibers connecting the brain with the spinal cord, 
often leading to permanent changes in strength, sensation and body functions, 
and in severe cases paralysis. Scientists around the world work hard to find 
ways to treat or even repair spinal cord injuries but few patients with complete 
immediate paralysis recover fully. Immediate paralysis is caused by direct 
damage to neurons and their extension in the spinal cord. Previous research has 
shown that blood pressure regulation may be key in saving these damaged neurons, 
as spinal cord injuries can break the communication between nerves that is 
involved in controlling blood pressure. This can lead to a vicious cycle of 
dysregulation of blood pressure and limit the supply of blood and oxygen to the 
damaged spinal cord tissue, exacerbating the death of spinal neurons. Management 
of blood pressure is therefore a key target for spinal cord injury care, but so 
far, the precise thresholds to enable neurons to recover are poorly understood. 
To find out more, Torres-Espin, Haefeli et al. used machine learning software to 
analyze previously recorded blood pressure and heart rate data obtained from 118 
patients that underwent spinal cord surgery after acute spinal cord injury. The 
analyses revealed that patients who suffered from either low or high blood 
pressure during surgery had poorer prospects of recovery. Statistical models 
confirming these findings showed that the optimal blood pressure range to ensure 
recovery lies between 76 to 104-117 mmHg. Any deviation from this narrow window 
would dramatically worsen the ability to recover. These findings suggests that 
dysregulated blood pressure during surgery affects to odds of recovery in 
patients with a spinal cord injury. Torres-Espin, Haefeli et al. provide 
specific information that could improve current clinical practice in trauma 
centers. In the future, such machine learning tools and models could help 
develop real-time models that could predict the likelihood of a patient’s 
recovery following spinal cord injury and related neurological conditions.

The dental practice has largely evolved in the last 50 years following a better 
understanding of the biomechanical behaviour of teeth and its supporting 
structures, as well as developments in the fields of imaging and biomaterials. 
However, many patients still encounter treatment failures; this is related to 
the complex nature of evaluating the biomechanical aspects of each clinical 
situation due to the numerous patient-specific parameters, such as occlusion and 
root anatomy. In parallel, the advent of cone beam computed tomography enabled 
researchers in the field of odontology as well as clinicians to gather and model 
patient data with sufficient accuracy using image processing and finite element 
technologies. These developments gave rise to a new precision medicine concept 
that proposes to individually assess anatomical and biomechanical 
characteristics and adapt treatment options accordingly. While this approach is 
already applied in maxillofacial surgery, its implementation in dentistry is 
still restricted. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence make 
it possible to automate several parts of the laborious modelling task, bringing 
such user-assisted decision-support tools closer to both clinicians and 
researchers. Therefore, the present narrative review aimed to present and 
discuss the current literature investigating patient-specific modelling in 
dentistry, its state-of-the-art applications, and research perspectives.

BACKGROUND: Longitudinal neuroimaging provides spatiotemporal brain data (STBD) 
measurement that can be utilised to understand dynamic changes in brain 
structure and/or function underpinning cognitive activities. Making sense of 
such highly interactive information is challenging, given that the features 
manifest intricate temporal, causal relations between the spatially distributed 
neural sources in the brain.
METHODS: The current paper argues for the advancement of deep learning 
algorithms in brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNN), capable of modelling 
structural data across time (longitudinal measurement) and space (anatomical 
components). The paper proposes a methodology and a computational architecture 
based on SNN for building personalised predictive models from longitudinal brain 
data to accurately detect, understand, and predict the dynamics of an 
individual's functional brain state. The methodology includes finding clusters 
of similar data to each individual, data interpolation, deep learning in a 
3-dimensional brain-template structured SNN model, classification and prediction 
of individual outcome, visualisation of structural brain changes related to the 
predicted outcomes, interpretation of results, and individual and group 
predictive marker discovery.
RESULTS: To demonstrate the functionality of the proposed methodology, the paper 
presents experimental results on a longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
dataset derived from 175 older adults of the internationally recognised 
community-based cohort Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (MAS) spanning 6 years of 
follow-up.
SIGNIFICANCE: The models were able to accurately classify and predict 2 years 
ahead of cognitive decline, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia 
with 95% and 91% accuracy, respectively. The proposed methodology also offers a 
3-dimensional visualisation of the MRI models reflecting the dynamic patterns of 
regional changes in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and brain volume over 6 
years.
CONCLUSION: The method is efficient for personalised predictive modelling on a 
wide range of neuroimaging longitudinal data, including also demographic, 
genetic, and clinical data. As a case study, it resulted in finding predictive 
markers for MCI and dementia as dynamic brain patterns using MRI data.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with long standing diabetes duration can experience 
damage to small microvascular blood vessels leading to diabetes complications 
(DCs) and increased mortality. Precision diagnostic tailors a diagnosis to an 
individual by using biomedical information. Blood small molecule profiling 
coupled with machine learning (ML) can facilitate the goals of precision 
diagnostics, including earlier diagnosis and individualized risk scoring.
METHODS: Using data in a cohort of 537 adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) we 
predicted five-year progression to DCs. Prediction models were computed first 
with clinical risk factors at baseline and then with clinical risk factors and 
blood-derived molecular data at baseline. Progression of diabetic kidney disease 
and diabetic retinopathy were predicted in two complication-specific models.
FINDINGS: The model predicts the progression to diabetic kidney disease with 
accuracy: 0.96 ± 0.25 and 0.96 ± 0.06 area under curve, AUC, with clinical 
measurements and with small molecule predictors respectively and highlighted 
main predictors to be albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate, retinopathy 
status at baseline, sugar derivatives and ketones. For diabetic retinopathy, AUC 
0.75 ± 0.14 and 0.79 ± 0.16 with clinical measurements and with small molecule 
predictors respectively and highlighted key predictors, albuminuria, glomerular 
filtration rate and retinopathy status at baseline. Individual risk scores were 
built to visualize results.
INTERPRETATION: With further validation ML tools could facilitate the 
implementation of precision diagnosis in the clinic. It is envisaged that 
patients could be screened for complications, before these occur, thus 
preserving healthy life-years for persons with diabetes.

Background - Recently, there have been attempts to develop mHealth applications 
for asthma self-management. However, there is a lack of applications that can 
offer accurate predictions of asthma exacerbation using the weather triggers and 
demographic characteristics to give tailored response to users. This paper 
proposes an optimised Deep Neural Network Regression (DNNR) model to predict 
asthma exacerbation based on personalised weather triggers. Methods - With the 
aim of integrating weather, demography, and asthma tracking, an mHealth 
application was developed where users conduct the Asthma Control Test (ACT) to 
identify the chances of their asthma exacerbation. The asthma dataset consists 
of panel data from 10 users that includes 1010 ACT scores as the target output. 
Moreover, the dataset contains 10 input features which include five weather 
features (temperature, humidity, air-pressure, UV-index, wind-speed) and five 
demography features (age, gender, outdoor-job, outdoor-activities, location). 
Results - Using the DNNR model on the asthma dataset, a score of 0.83 was 
achieved with Mean Absolute Error (MAE)=1.44 and Mean Squared Error (MSE)=3.62. 
It was recognised that, for effective asthma self-management, the prediction 
errors must be in the acceptable loss range (error<0.5). Therefore, an 
optimisation process was proposed to reduce the error rates and increase the 
accuracy by applying standardisation and fragmented-grid-search. Consequently, 
the optimised-DNNR model (with 2 hidden-layers and 50 hidden-nodes) using the 
Adam optimiser achieved a 94% accuracy with MAE=0.20 and MSE=0.09. Conclusions - 
This study is the first of its kind that recognises the potentials of DNNR to 
identify the correlation patterns among asthma, weather, and demographic 
variables. The optimised-DNNR model provides predictions with a significantly 
higher accuracy rate than the existing predictive models and using less 
computing time. Thus, the optimisation process is useful to build an enhanced 
model that can be integrated into the asthma self-management for mHealth 
application.

PURPOSE: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panels are frequently completed 
for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with 
highly actionable gene variants have improved outcomes and reduced toxicities 
with the use of corresponding targeted agents. We sought to identify barriers to 
targeted agent use within the Veterans Health Affairs' National Precision 
Oncology Program (NPOP).
METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of patients with NSCLC who underwent NGS 
multigene panels through NPOP between July 2015 and February 2019 was conducted. 
Patients who were assigned level 1 or 2A evidence for oncogenic gene variants by 
an artificial intelligence offering (IBM Watson for Genomics [WfG]) and NPOP 
staff were selected. Antineoplastic drug prescriptions and provider notes were 
reviewed. Reasons for withholding targeted treatments were categorized.
RESULTS: Of 1,749 patients with NSCLC who successfully underwent NGS gene panel 
testing, 112 (6.4%) patients were assigned level 1 and/or 2A evidence for 
available targeted treatments by WfG and NPOP staff. All highly actionable gene 
variants were within ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, MET, RET, and ROS1. Of these, 36 
(32.1%) patients were not prescribed targeted agents. The three most common 
reasons were (1) patient did not carry a diagnosis of metastatic disease 
(33.3%), (2) treating provider did not comment on the NGS results (25.0%), and 
(3) provider felt that patient could not tolerate therapy (19.4%). No patients 
were denied access to level 1 or 2A targeted drugs because of rejection of a 
nonformulary drug request.
CONCLUSION: A substantial minority of patients with NSCLC bearing highly 
actionable gene variants are not prescribed targeted agents. Further provider- 
and pathologist-directed educational efforts and implementation of health 
informatics systems to provide real-time decision support for test ordering and 
interpretation are needed.

We propose a differentiable volumetric mesh voxelization technique based on 
deformation of a shape-model, and demonstrate that it can be used to predict 
left-ventricular anatomies directly from magnetic resonance image slice data. 
The predicted anatomies are volumetric meshes suitable for direct inclusion in 
biophysical simulations. The proposed method can leverage existing (pixel-based) 
segmentation networks, and does not require any ground truth paired image and 
mesh training data. We demonstrate that this approach produces accurate 
predictions from few slices, and can combine information from images acquired in 
different views (e.g. fusing shape information from short axis and long axis 
slices). We demonstrate that the proposed method is several times faster than a 
state-of-the-art registration based method. Additionally, we show that our 
method can correct for slice misalignment, and is robust to incomplete and 
inaccurate input data. We further demonstrate that by fitting a mesh to every 
frame of 4D data we can determine ejection fraction, stroke volume and strain.

Monitoring the status of culture fish is an essential task for precision 
aquaculture using a smart underwater imaging device as a non-intrusive way of 
sensing to monitor freely swimming fish even in turbid or low-ambient-light 
waters. This paper developed a two-mode underwater surveillance camera system 
consisting of a sonar imaging device and a stereo camera. The sonar imaging 
device has two cloud-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) functions that estimate 
the quantity and the distribution of the length and weight of fish in a crowded 
fish school. Because sonar images can be noisy and fish instances of an 
overcrowded fish school are often overlapped, machine learning technologies, 
such as Mask R-CNN, Gaussian mixture models, convolutional neural networks, and 
semantic segmentation networks were employed to address the difficulty in the 
analysis of fish in sonar images. Furthermore, the sonar and stereo RGB images 
were aligned in the 3D space, offering an additional AI function for fish 
annotation based on RGB images. The proposed two-mode surveillance camera was 
tested to collect data from aquaculture tanks and off-shore net cages using a 
cloud-based AIoT system. The accuracy of the proposed AI functions based on 
human-annotated fish metric data sets were tested to verify the feasibility and 
suitability of the smart camera for the estimation of remote underwater fish 
metrics.

DNA methylation data-based precision cancer diagnostics is emerging as the state 
of the art for molecular tumor classification. Standards for choosing 
statistical methods with regard to well-calibrated probability estimates for 
these typically highly multiclass classification tasks are still lacking. To 
support this choice, we evaluated well-established machine learning (ML) 
classifiers including random forests (RFs), elastic net (ELNET), support vector 
machines (SVMs) and boosted trees in combination with post-processing algorithms 
and developed ML workflows that allow for unbiased class probability (CP) 
estimation. Calibrators included ridge-penalized multinomial logistic regression 
(MR) and Platt scaling by fitting logistic regression (LR) and Firth's penalized 
LR. We compared these workflows on a recently published brain tumor 450k DNA 
methylation cohort of 2,801 samples with 91 diagnostic categories using a 5 × 
5-fold nested cross-validation scheme and demonstrated their generalizability on 
external data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. ELNET was the top stand-alone 
classifier with the best calibration profiles. The best overall two-stage 
workflow was MR-calibrated SVM with linear kernels closely followed by 
ridge-calibrated tuned RF. For calibration, MR was the most effective regardless 
of the primary classifier. The protocols developed as a result of these 
comparisons provide valuable guidance on choosing ML workflows and their tuning 
to generate well-calibrated CP estimates for precision diagnostics using DNA 
methylation data. Computation times vary depending on the ML algorithm from <15 
min to 5 d using multi-core desktop PCs. Detailed scripts in the open-source R 
language are freely available on GitHub, targeting users with intermediate 
experience in bioinformatics and statistics and using R with Bioconductor 
extensions.

Double-precision floating-point arithmetic (FP64) has been the de facto standard 
for engineering and scientific simulations for several decades. Problem 
complexity and the sheer volume of data coming from various instruments and 
sensors motivate researchers to mix and match various approaches to optimize 
compute resources, including different levels of floating-point precision. In 
recent years, machine learning has motivated hardware support for half-precision 
floating-point arithmetic. A primary challenge in high-performance computing is 
to leverage reduced-precision and mixed-precision hardware. We show how the 
FP16/FP32 Tensor Cores on NVIDIA GPUs can be exploited to accelerate the 
solution of linear systems of equations Ax = b without sacrificing numerical 
stability. The techniques we employ include multiprecision LU factorization, the 
preconditioned generalized minimal residual algorithm (GMRES), and scaling and 
auto-adaptive rounding to avoid overflow. We also show how to efficiently handle 
systems with multiple right-hand sides. On the NVIDIA Quadro GV100 (Volta) GPU, 
we achieve a 4 × -5 ×  performance increase and 5× better energy efficiency 
versus the standard FP64 implementation while maintaining an FP64 level of 
numerical stability.

In the military, police, security companies, and shooting sports, precision 
shooting training is of the outmost importance. In order to achieve high 
shooting accuracy, a lot of training is needed. As a result, trainees use a 
large number of cartridges and a considerable amount of time of professional 
trainers, which can cost a lot. Our motivation is to reduce costs and shorten 
training time by introducing an augmented biofeedback system based on machine 
learning techniques. We are designing a system that can detect and provide 
feedback on three types of errors that regularly occur during a precision 
shooting practice: excessive hand movement error, aiming error and triggering 
error. The system is designed to provide concurrent feedback on the hand 
movement error and terminal feedback on the other two errors. Machine learning 
techniques are used innovatively to identify hand movement errors; the other two 
errors are identified by the threshold approach. To correct the excessive hand 
movement error, a precision shot accuracy prediction model based on Random 
Forest has proven to be the most suitable. The experimental results show that: 
(1) the proposed Random Forest (RF) model achieves the prediction accuracy of 
91.27%, higher than any of the other reference models, and (2) hand movement is 
strongly related to the accuracy of precision shooting. Appropriate use of the 
proposed augmented biofeedback system will result in a lower number of rounds 
used and shorten the precision shooting training process.

High-precision inversion of dynamic radiography using hydrodynamic features.

Hossain M, Nadiga BT, Korobkin O, Klasky ML, Schei JL, Burby JW, McCann MT, 
Wilcox T, De S, Bouman CA.

While radiography is routinely used to probe complex, evolving density fields in 
research areas ranging from materials science to shock physics to inertial 
confinement fusion and other national security applications, complications 
resulting from noise, scatter, complex beam dynamics, etc. prevent current 
methods of reconstructing density from being accurate enough to identify the 
underlying physics with sufficient confidence. In this work, we show that using 
only features that are robustly identifiable in radiographs and combining them 
with the underlying hydrodynamic equations of motion using a machine learning 
approach of a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) provides a new 
and effective approach to determine density fields from a dynamic sequence of 
radiographs. In particular, we demonstrate the ability of this method to 
outperform a traditional, direct radiograph to density reconstruction in the 
presence of scatter, even when relatively small amounts of scatter are present. 
Our experiments on synthetic data show that the approach can produce high 
quality, robust reconstructions. We also show that the distance (in feature 
space) between a testing radiograph and the training set can serve as a 
diagnostic of the accuracy of the reconstruction.

Ovarian failure (OF) is a common cause of infertility usually diagnosed as 
idiopathic, with genetic causes accounting for 10-25% of cases. Whole-exome 
sequencing (WES) may enable identifying contributing genes and variant profiles 
to stratify the population into subtypes of OF. This study sought to identify a 
blood-based gene variant profile using accumulation of rare variants to promote 
precision medicine in fertility preservation programs. A case-control (n = 118, 
n = 32, respectively) WES study was performed in which only non-synonymous rare 
variants <5% minor allele frequency (MAF; in the IGSR) and coverage ≥ 100× were 
considered. A profile of 66 variants of uncertain significance was used for 
training an unsupervised machine learning model to separate cases from controls 
(97.2% sensitivity, 99.2% specificity) and stratify the population into two 
subtypes of OF (A and B) (93.31% sensitivity, 96.67% specificity). Model testing 
within the IGSR female population predicted 0.5% of women as subtype A and 2.4% 
as subtype B. This is the first study linking OF to the accumulation of rare 
variants and generates a new potential taxonomy supporting application of this 
approach for precision medicine in fertility preservation.

Our modern era is witnessing an increasing infertility rate worldwide. Although 
some of the causes can be attributed to our modern lifestyle (e.g., persistent 
organic pollutants, late pregnancy), our knowledge of the human ovarian tissue 
has remained limited and insufficient to reverse the infertility statistics. 
Indeed, all efforts have been focused on the endocrine and cellular function in 
support of the cell theory that dates back to the 18th century, while the human 
ovarian matrisome is still under-described. Hereby, we unveil the extracellular 
side of the story during different periods of the ovary life, demonstrating that 
follicle survival and development, and ultimately fertility, would not be 
possible without its involvement. We examined the human ovarian matrisome and 
described its remodeling from prepuberty until menopause, creating the first 
ovarian proteomic codex. Here, we confidently identified and quantified 98 
matrisome proteins present in the three ovary groups. Among them, 26 were 
expressed differently among age groups, delineating a peculiar matrisomal 
fingerprint at each stage. Such proteins could be potential biomarkers 
phenotyping ovarian ECM at each age phase of female reproductive life. Beyond 
proteomics, our study presents a unique approach to understanding the data and 
depicting the spatiotemporal ECM-intracellular signaling networks and remodeling 
with age through imaging, advanced text-mining based on natural language 
processing technology, machine learning, and data sonification. Our findings 
provide essential context for healthy ovarian physiology, identifying and 
characterizing disease states, and recapitulating physiological tissues or 
development in vitro. This comprehensive proteomics analysis represents the 
ovarian proteomic codex and contributes to an improved understanding of the 
critical roles that ECM plays throughout the ovarian life span.

This paper proposes a novel identity management framework for Internet of Things 
(IoT) and cloud computing-based personalized healthcare systems. The proposed 
framework uses multimodal encrypted biometric traits to perform authentication. 
It employs a combination of centralized and federated identity access techniques 
along with biometric based continuous authentication. The framework uses a 
fusion of electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals when 
performing authentication. In addition to relying on the unique identification 
characteristics of the users' biometric traits, the security of the framework is 
empowered by the use of Homomorphic Encryption (HE). The use of HE allows 
patients' data to stay encrypted when being processed or analyzed in the cloud. 
Thus, providing not only a fast and reliable authentication mechanism, but also 
closing the door to many traditional security attacks. The framework's 
performance was evaluated and validated using a machine learning (ML) model that 
tested the framework using a dataset of 25 users in seating positions. Compared 
to using just ECG or PPG signals, the results of using the proposed fused-based 
biometric framework showed that it was successful in identifying and 
authenticating all 25 users with 100% accuracy. Hence, offering some significant 
improvements to the overall security and privacy of personalized healthcare 
systems.

With the advent of the era of artificial intelligence, as an emerging 
technology, radiomics can extract a large amount of quantitative information 
describing the physiological condition and phenotypic characteristics of tumors 
with high throughput from the massive data of CT, MRI and other imaging 
tomography, and analyze these high-dimensional imaging omics features containing 
disease pathophysiological information can be used to accurately determine tumor 
differentiation, staging, and predict tumor behavior, which has broad 
application prospects. This article aims to introduce the technical principles 
of radiomics and its abdominal tumor application status, and to prospect its 
application prospects in pediatric abdominal neuroblastoma.

BACKGROUND: Scoring models are useful tools that guide the attending clinician 
in gauging the severity of disease evolution and in evaluating the efficacy of 
treatment. There are few tools available with this purpose for the non-human 
patient, including horses. We aimed (i) to adapt the simplified acute physiology 
score 3 (SAPS-3) model for the equine species, reaching a margin of accuracy 
greater than 75% in the calculation of the probability of survival/death and 
(ii) to build a decision tree that helps the attending veterinarian in 
assessment of the clinical evolution of the equine patient.
METHODS: From an initial pool of 5568 medical records from University-based 
Veterinary Hospitals, a final cohort of 1000 was further mined manually for data 
extraction. A set of 19 variables were evaluated and tested by five machine 
learning data mining algorithms.
RESULTS: The final scoring model, named EqSAPS for equine simplified acute 
physiology score, reached 91.83% of correct estimates (post hoc) for probability 
of death within 24 hours upon hospitalization. The area under receiver operating 
characteristic curve for outcome 'death' was 0.742, while for 'survival' was 
0.652. The final decision tree was able to refine prognosis of patients whose 
EqSAPS score suggested 'death'.
CONCLUSION: EqSAPS is a useful tool to gauge the severity of the clinical 
presentation of the equine patient.

Previous research has shown that sensors monitoring lying behaviours and feeding 
can detect early signs of ill health in calves. There is evidence to suggest 
that monitoring change in a single behaviour might not be enough for disease 
prediction. In calves, multiple behaviours such as locomotor play, 
self-grooming, feeding and activity whilst lying are likely to be informative. 
However, these behaviours can occur rarely in the real world, which means simply 
counting behaviours based on the prediction of a classifier can lead to 
overestimation. Here, we equipped thirteen pre-weaned dairy calves with 
collar-mounted sensors and monitored their behaviour with video cameras. 
Behavioural observations were recorded and merged with sensor signals. Features 
were calculated for 1-10-s windows and an AdaBoost ensemble learning algorithm 
implemented to classify behaviours. Finally, we developed an adjusted count 
quantification algorithm to predict the prevalence of locomotor play behaviour 
on a test dataset with low true prevalence (0.27%). Our algorithm identified 
locomotor play (99.73% accuracy), self-grooming (98.18% accuracy), ruminating 
(94.47% accuracy), non-nutritive suckling (94.96% accuracy), nutritive suckling 
(96.44% accuracy), active lying (90.38% accuracy) and non-active lying (90.38% 
accuracy). Our results detail recommended sampling frequencies, feature 
selection and window size. The quantification estimates of locomotor play 
behaviour were highly correlated with the true prevalence (0.97; p < 0.001) with 
a total overestimation of 18.97%. This study is the first to implement machine 
learning approaches for multi-class behaviour identification as well as 
behaviour quantification in calves. This has potential to contribute towards new 
insights to evaluate the health and welfare in calves by use of wearable 
sensors.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has its onset many decades before dementia develops, 
and work is ongoing to characterise individuals at risk of decline on the basis 
of early detection through biomarker and cognitive testing as well as the 
presence/absence of identified risk factors. Risk prediction models for AD based 
on various computational approaches, including machine learning, are being 
developed with promising results. However, these approaches have been criticised 
as they are unable to generalise due to over-reliance on one data source, poor 
internal and external validations, and lack of understanding of prediction 
models, thereby limiting the clinical utility of these prediction models. We 
propose a framework that employs a transfer-learning paradigm with ensemble 
learning algorithms to develop explainable personalised risk prediction models 
for dementia. Our prediction models, known as source models, are initially 
trained and tested using a publicly available dataset (n = 84,856, mean age = 69 
years) with 14 years of follow-up samples to predict the individual risk of 
developing dementia. The decision boundaries of the best source model are 
further updated by using an alternative dataset from a different and much 
younger population (n = 473, mean age = 52 years) to obtain an additional 
prediction model known as the target model. We further apply the SHapely 
Additive exPlanation (SHAP) algorithm to visualise the risk factors responsible 
for the prediction at both population and individual levels. The best source 
model achieves a geometric accuracy of 87%, specificity of 99%, and sensitivity 
of 76%. In comparison to a baseline model, our target model achieves better 
performance across several performance metrics, within an increase in geometric 
accuracy of 16.9%, specificity of 2.7%, and sensitivity of 19.1%, an area under 
the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 11% and a transfer learning efficacy 
rate of 20.6%. The strength of our approach is the large sample size used in 
training the source model, transferring and applying the "knowledge" to another 
dataset from a different and undiagnosed population for the early detection and 
prediction of dementia risk, and the ability to visualise the interaction of the 
risk factors that drive the prediction. This approach has direct clinical 
utility.

Manuscripts that have successfully used machine learning (ML) to predict a 
variety of perioperative outcomes often use only a limited number of features 
selected by a clinician. We hypothesized that techniques leveraging a broad set 
of features for patient laboratory results, medications, and the surgical 
procedure name would improve performance as compared to a more limited set of 
features chosen by clinicians. Feature vectors for laboratory results included 
702 features total derived from 39 laboratory tests, medications consisted of a 
binary flag for 126 commonly used medications, procedure name used the Word2Vec 
package for create a vector of length 100. Nine models were trained: baseline 
features, one for each of the three types of data Baseline + Each data type, 
(all features, and then all features with feature reduction algorithm. Across 
both outcomes the models that contained all features (model 8) (Mortality 
ROC-AUC 94.32 ± 1.01, PR-AUC 36.80 ± 5.10 AKI ROC-AUC 92.45 ± 0.64, PR-AUC 
76.22 ± 1.95) was superior to models with only subsets of features. 
Featurization techniques leveraging a broad away of clinical data can improve 
performance of perioperative prediction models.

BACKGROUND: Ability to thrive and time-to-recurrence following treatment are 
important parameters to assess in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), 
given its dismal prognosis. Though there is an ongoing debate whether it can be 
considered an appropriate surrogate endpoint for overall survival in clinical 
trials, progression-free survival (PFS) is routinely used for clinical 
decision-making.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether machine learning (ML)-based models can 
reliably stratify newly diagnosed GBM patients into prognostic subclasses on PFS 
basis, identifying those at higher risk for an early recurrence (≤6 mo).
METHODS: Data were extracted from a multicentric database, according to the 
following eligibility criteria: histopathologically verified GBM and follow-up 
>12 mo: 474 patients met our inclusion criteria and were included in the 
analysis. Relevant demographic, clinical, molecular, and radiological variables 
were selected by a feature selection algorithm (Boruta) and used to build a 
ML-based model.
RESULTS: Random forest prediction model, evaluated on an 80:20 split ratio, 
achieved an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77; 0.83) demonstrating high discriminative 
ability. Optimizing the predictive value derived from the linear and nonlinear 
combinations of the selected input features, our model outperformed across all 
performance metrics multivariable logistic regression.
CONCLUSION: A robust ML-based prediction model that identifies patients at high 
risk for early recurrence was successfully trained and internally validated. 
Considerable effort remains to integrate these predictions in a patient-centered 
care context.

Precision oncology involves identifying drugs that will effectively treat a 
tumor and then prescribing an optimal clinical treatment regimen. However, most 
first-line chemotherapy drugs do not have biomarkers to guide their application. 
For molecularly targeted drugs, using the genomic status of a drug target as a 
therapeutic indicator has limitations. In this study, machine learning methods 
(e.g., deep learning) were used to identify informative features from 
genome-scale omics data and to train classifiers for predicting the 
effectiveness of drugs in cancer cell lines. The methodology introduced here can 
accurately predict the efficacy of drugs, regardless of whether they are 
molecularly targeted or nonspecific chemotherapy drugs. This approach, on a 
per-drug basis, can identify sensitive cancer cells with an average sensitivity 
of 0.82 and specificity of 0.82; on a per-cell line basis, it can identify 
effective drugs with an average sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.82. 
This report describes a data-driven precision medicine approach that is not only 
generalizable but also optimizes therapeutic efficacy. The framework detailed 
herein, when successfully translated to clinical environments, could 
significantly broaden the scope of precision oncology beyond targeted therapies, 
benefiting an expanded proportion of cancer patients. Mol Cancer Res; 16(2);

The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed deeply entrenched structural inequalities 
that resulted in an excess of mortality and morbidity in certain racial and 
ethnic groups in the United States. Therefore, this paper examines from the US 
perspective how structural racism and defective data collection on racial and 
ethnic minorities can negatively influence the development of precision public 
health (PPH) approaches to tackle the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, 
the effects of structural and data racism on the development of fair and 
inclusive data-driven components of PPH interventions are discussed, such as 
with the use of machine learning algorithms to predict public health risks. The 
objective of this viewpoint is thus to inform public health policymaking with 
regard to the development of ethically sound PPH interventions against COVID-19. 
Particular attention is given to components of structural racism (eg, hospital 
segregation, implicit and organizational bias, digital divide, and 
sociopolitical influences) that are likely to hinder such approaches from 
achieving their social justice and health equity goals.

The incidence of obesity in our country is increasing year by year. Diet and 
lifestyle interventions are the most commonly used weight loss measures, but 
their intervention effects are affected by individual genetics, environment and 
other factors. Genome-wide association analysis has found many SNPs related to 
weight loss, and explored the interaction between these loci and diet, 
intestinal flora and other environmental factors. This article summarizes the 
study of single nucleotide polymorphisms, the analysis of gene-environment 
interactions related to diet interventions for weight loss, and the multi-loci 
analysis and prediction models such as genetic risk scores and machine learning 
modeling in weight loss, which provides reference for the further application 
and development of the precise nutrition in medical weight loss.

In the past decade, growing interest in micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) has 
catapulted these small, non-coding nucleic acids to the forefront of biomarker 
research. Advances in scientific knowledge have made it clear that miRNAs play a 
vital role in regulating cellular physiology throughout the human body. 
Perturbations in miRNA signaling have also been described in a variety of 
pediatric conditions-from cancer, to renal failure, to traumatic brain injury. 
Likewise, the number of studies across pediatric disciplines that pair patient 
miRNA-omics with longitudinal clinical data are growing. Analyses of these 
voluminous, multivariate data sets require understanding of pediatric phenotypic 
data, data science, and genomics. Use of machine learning techniques to aid in 
biomarker detection have helped decipher background noise from biologically 
meaningful changes in the data. Further, emerging research suggests that miRNAs 
may have potential as therapeutic targets for pediatric precision care. Here, we 
review current miRNA biomarkers of pediatric diseases and studies that have 
combined machine learning techniques, miRNA-omics, and patient health data to 
identify novel biomarkers and potential therapeutics for pediatric diseases. 
IMPACT: In the following review article, we summarized how recent developments 
in microRNA research may be coupled with machine learning techniques to advance 
pediatric precision care.

First two decades of the twenty-first century are characterised by epidemics of 
non-communicable diseases such as many hundreds of millions of patients 
diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases and the type 2 diabetes mellitus, breast, 
lung, liver and prostate malignancies, neurological, sleep, mood and eye 
disorders, amongst others. Consequent socio-economic burden is tremendous. 
Unprecedented decrease in age of maladaptive individuals has been reported. The 
absolute majority of expanding non-communicable disorders carry a chronic 
character, over a couple of years progressing from reversible suboptimal health 
conditions to irreversible severe pathologies and cascading collateral 
complications. The time-frame between onset of SHS and clinical manifestation of 
associated disorders is the operational area for an application of reliable risk 
assessment tools and predictive diagnostics followed by the cost-effective 
targeted prevention and treatments tailored to the person. This article 
demonstrates advanced strategies in bio/medical sciences and healthcare focused 
on suboptimal health conditions in the frame-work of Predictive, Preventive and 
Personalised Medicine (3PM/PPPM). Potential benefits in healthcare systems and 
for society at large include but are not restricted to an improved life-quality 
of major populations and socio-economical groups, advanced professionalism of 
healthcare-givers and sustainable healthcare economy. Amongst others, following 
medical areas are proposed to strongly benefit from PPPM strategies applied to 
the identification and treatment of suboptimal health conditions:Stress overload 
associated pathologiesMale and female healthPlanned pregnanciesPeriodontal 
healthEye disordersInflammatory disorders, wound healing and pain management 
with associated complicationsMetabolic disorders and suboptimal body 
weightCardiovascular pathologiesCancersStroke, particularly of unknown aetiology 
and in young individualsSleep medicineSports medicineImproved individual 
outcomes under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19.

Precision oncology is currently based on pairing molecularly targeted agents 
(MTA) to predefined single driver genes or biomarkers. Each tumor harbors a 
combination of a large number of potential genetic alterations of multiple 
driver genes in a complex system that limits the potential of this approach. We 
have developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted computational method, 
the digital drug-assignment (DDA) system, to prioritize potential MTAs for each 
cancer patient based on the complex individual molecular profile of their tumor. 
We analyzed the clinical benefit of the DDA system on the molecular and clinical 
outcome data of patients treated in the SHIVA01 precision oncology clinical 
trial with MTAs matched to individual genetic alterations or biomarkers of their 
tumor. We found that the DDA score assigned to MTAs was significantly higher in 
patients experiencing disease control than in patients with progressive disease 
(1523 versus 580, P = 0.037). The median PFS was also significantly longer in 
patients receiving MTAs with high (1000+ <) than with low (<0) DDA scores (3.95 
versus 1.95 months, P = 0.044). Our results indicate that AI-based systems, like 
DDA, are promising new tools for oncologists to improve the clinical benefit of 
precision oncology.

BACKGROUND: The context in which a behavioral intervention is delivered is an 
important source of variability and systematic approaches are needed to identify 
and quantify contextual factors that may influence intervention efficacy. 
Machine learning-based phenotyping methods can contribute to a new precision 
health paradigm by informing personalized behavior interventions. Two primary 
goals of precision health, identifying population subgroups and highlighting 
behavioral intervention targets, can be addressed with psychosocial-behavioral 
phenotypes. We propose a method for psychosocial-behavioral phenotyping that 
models social determinants of health in addition to individual-level 
psychological and behavioral factors.
PURPOSE: To demonstrate a novel application of machine learning for 
psychosocial-behavioral phenotyping, the identification of subgroups with 
similar combinations of psychosocial characteristics.
METHODS: In this secondary analysis of psychosocial and behavioral data from a 
community cohort (n = 5,883), we optimized a multichannel mixed membership model 
(MC3M) using Bayesian inference to identify psychosocial-behavioral phenotypes 
and used logistic regression to determine which phenotypes were associated with 
elevated weight status (BMI ≥ 25kg/m2).
RESULTS: We identified 20 psychosocial-behavioral phenotypes. Phenotypes were 
conceptually consistent as well as discriminative; most participants had only 
one active phenotype. Two phenotypes were significantly positively associated 
with elevated weight status; four phenotypes were significantly negatively 
associated. Each phenotype suggested different contextual considerations for 
intervention design.
CONCLUSIONS: By depicting the complexity of psychological and social 
determinants of health while also providing actionable insight about 
similarities and differences among members of the same community, 
psychosocial-behavioral phenotypes can identify potential intervention targets 
in context.

We propose a method for data provision, validation, and service expansion for 
the spread of a lifelog-based digital healthcare platform. The platform is an 
operational cloud-based platform, implemented in 2020, that has launched a tool 
that can validate and de-identify personal information in a data acquisition 
system dedicated to a center. The data acquired by the platform can be processed 
into products of statistical analysis and artificial intelligence (AI)-based 
deep learning modules. Application programming interfaces (APIs) have been 
developed to open data and can be linked in a programmatic manner. As a 
standardized policy, a series of procedures were performed from data collection 
to external sharing. The proposed platform collected 321.42 GB of data for 146 
types of data. The reliability and consistency of the data were evaluated by an 
information system audit institution, with a defects ratio of approximately 
0.03%. We presented definitions and examples of APIs developed in 17 functional 
units for data opening. In addition, the suitability of the de-identification 
tool was confirmed by evaluating the reduced risk of re-identification using 
quasi-identifiers. We presented specific methods for data verification, personal 
information de-identification, and service provision to ensure the 
sustainability of future digital healthcare platforms for precision medicine. 
The platform can contribute to the diffusion of the platform by linking data 
with external organizations and research environments in safe zones based on 
data reliability.

The precisionFDA Truth Challenge V2 aimed to assess the state of the art of 
variant calling in challenging genomic regions. Starting with FASTQs, 20 
challenge participants applied their variant-calling pipelines and submitted 64 
variant call sets for one or more sequencing technologies (Illumina, PacBio 
HiFi, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Submissions were evaluated following 
best practices for benchmarking small variants with updated Genome in a Bottle 
benchmark sets and genome stratifications. Challenge submissions included 
numerous innovative methods, with graph-based and machine learning methods 
scoring best for short-read and long-read datasets, respectively. With machine 
learning approaches, combining multiple sequencing technologies performed 
particularly well. Recent developments in sequencing and variant calling have 
enabled benchmarking variants in challenging genomic regions, paving the way for 
the identification of previously unknown clinically relevant variants.

We present a second-order recursive Fermi-operator expansion scheme using mixed 
precision floating point operations to perform electronic structure calculations 
using tensor core units. A performance of over 100 teraFLOPs is achieved for 
half-precision floating point operations on Nvidia's A100 tensor core units. The 
second-order recursive Fermi-operator scheme is formulated in terms of a 
generalized, differentiable deep neural network structure, which solves the 
quantum mechanical electronic structure problem. We demonstrate how this network 
can be accelerated by optimizing the weight and bias values to substantially 
reduce the number of layers required for convergence. We also show how this 
machine learning approach can be used to optimize the coefficients of the 
recursive Fermi-operator expansion to accurately represent the fractional 
occupation numbers of the electronic states at finite temperatures.

Introduction: Oncologists have traditionally administered the maximum tolerated 
doses of drugs in chemotherapy. However, these toxicity-guided doses may lead to 
suboptimal efficacy. CURATE.AI is an indication-agnostic, mechanism-independent 
and efficacy-driven personalised dosing platform that may offer a more optimal 
solution. While CURATE.AI has already been applied in a variety of clinical 
settings, there are no prior randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 
CURATE.AI-guided chemotherapy dosing for solid tumours. Therefore, we aim to 
assess the technical and logistical feasibility of a future RCT for 
CURATE.AI-guided solid tumour chemotherapy dosing. We will also collect 
exploratory data on efficacy and toxicity, which will inform RCT power 
calculations. Methods and analysis: This is an open-label, single-arm, 
two-centre, prospective pilot clinical trial, recruiting adults with metastatic 
solid tumours and raised baseline tumour marker levels who are planned for 
palliative-intent, capecitabine-based chemotherapy. As CURATE.AI is a small data 
platform, it will guide drug dosing for each participant based only on their own 
tumour marker levels and drug doses as input data. The primary outcome is the 
proportion of participants in whom CURATE.AI is successfully applied to provide 
efficacy-driven personalised dosing, as judged based on predefined 
considerations. Secondary outcomes include the timeliness of dose 
recommendations, participant and physician adherence to CURATE.AI-recommended 
doses, and the proportion of clinically significant dose changes. We aim to 
initially enrol 10 participants from two hospitals in Singapore, perform an 
interim analysis, and consider either cohort expansion or an RCT. Recruitment 
began in August 2020. This pilot clinical trial will provide key data for a 
future RCT of CURATE.AI-guided personalised dosing for precision oncology. 
Ethics and dissemination: The National Healthcare Group (NHG) Domain Specific 
Review Board has granted ethical approval for this study (DSRB 2020/00334). We 
will distribute our findings at scientific conferences and publish them in 
peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number: NCT04522284.

Radiomics, as an emerging technique of omics, shows the pathophysiological 
information of images via extracting innumerable quantitative features from 
digital medical images. In recent years, it has been an exponential increase in 
the number of radiomics studies. The applications of radiomics in hepatobiliary 
diseases at present include: assessment of liver fibrosis, discrimination of 
malignant from benign tumors, prediction of biological behavior, assessment of 
therapeutic response, and prognosis. Integrating radiomics analysis with machine 
learning algorithms has emerged as a non-invasive method for predicting liver 
fibrosis stages, microvascular invasion and post-resection recurrence in liver 
cancers, lymph node metastasis in biliary tract cancers as well as treatment 
response in colorectal liver metastasis, with high performance. Although the 
challenges remain in the clinical transformation of this technique, radiomics 
will have a broad application prospect in promoting the precision diagnosis and 
treatment of hepatobiliary diseases, backed by multi-center study with large 
sample size or multi-omics study.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Body-worn accelerometers are the most popular method 
for objectively assessing physical activity in older adults. Many studies have 
developed generic accelerometer cut-points for defining activity intensity in 
metabolic equivalents for older adults. However, methodological diversity in 
current studies has led to a great deal of variation in the resulting 
cut-points, even when using data from the same accelerometer. In addition, the 
generic cut-point approach assumes that 'one size fits all' which is rarely the 
case in real life. This study proposes a machine learning method for 
personalising activity intensity cut-points for older adults.
METHODS: Firstly, raw accelerometry data was collected from 33 older adults who 
performed set activities whilst wearing two accelerometer devices: GENEActive 
(wrist worn) and ActiGraph (hip worn). ROC analysis was applied to generate 
personalised cut-point for each data sample based on a device. Four cut-points 
have been considered: Sensitivity optimised Sedentary Behaviour; Specificity 
optimised Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity; Youden optimised Sedentary 
Behaviour; and Youden optimised Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity. Then, an 
additive regression algorithm trained on biodata features, that concern the 
individual characteristics of participants, was used to predict the cut-points. 
As the model output is a numeric cut-point value (and not discrete), evaluation 
was based on two error metrics, Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error. 
Standard Error of estimation was also calculated to measure the accuracy of 
prediction (goodness of fit) and this was used for performance comparison 
between our approach and the state-of-the-art. Hold-out and 10-Fold cross 
validation methods were used for performance validation and comparison.
RESULTS: The results show that our personalised approach performed consistently 
better than the state-of-the-art with 10-Fold cross validation on all four 
cut-points considered for both devices. For the ActiGraph device, the Standard 
Error of estimation from our approach was lower by 0.33 (Youden optimised 
Sedentary Behaviour), 9.50 (Sensitivity optimised Sedentary Behaviour), 0.64 
(Youden optimised Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity) and 22.11 (Specificity 
optimised Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity). Likewise, the Standard Error 
of estimation from our approach was lower for the GENEActiv device by 2.29 
(Youden optimised Sedentary Behaviour), 41.65 (Sensitivity optimised Sedentary 
Behaviour), 4.31 (Youden optimised Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity) and 
347.15 (Specificity optimised Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity).
CONCLUSIONS: personalised cut-point can be predicted without prior knowledge of 
accelerometry data. The results are very promising especially when we consider 
that our method predicts cut-points without prior knowledge of accelerometry 
data, unlike the state-of-the-art. More data is required to expand the scope of 
the experiments presented in this paper.

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests the immunomodulatory potential of genes 
in oncology. But the identification of immune attributes of genes is costly and 
time-consuming, which leads to an urgent demand to develop a prediction model.
METHOD: We developed a deep learning-based model to predict the immune 
properties of genes. This model is trained in 70% of samples and evaluated in 
30% of samples. Furthermore, it uncovers 60 new immune-related genes. We 
analyzed the expression perturbation and prognostic value of these genes in 
gastric cancer. Finally, we validated these genes in immunotherapy-related 
datasets to check the predictive potential of immunotherapeutic sensitivity.
RESULT: This model classifies genes as immune-promoted or immune-inhibited based 
on the human PPI network and it achieves an accuracy of 0.68 on the test set. It 
uncovers 60 new immune-related genes, most of which are validated in the 
published literature. These genes are found to be downregulated in gastric 
cancer and significantly associated with the immune microenvironment in gastric 
cancer. Analysis of immunotherapy shows that these genes can discriminate 
between responder and non-responder.
CONCLUSION: This model can facilitate the identification of immune properties of 
genes, decoding tumor-immune interactions for precision immunotherapy in 
oncology.

In the last decade there has been an exponential growth of research activity on 
the identification of correlations between vegetational indices elaborated by 
UAV imagery and productive and vegetative parameters of the vine. However, the 
acquisition and analysis of spectral data require costs and skills that are 
often not sufficiently available. In this context, the identification of 
geometric indices that allow the monitoring of spatial variability with low-cost 
instruments, without spectral analysis know-how but based on photogrammetry 
techniques with high-resolution RGB cameras, becomes extremely interesting. The 
aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of new canopy geometry-based 
indices for the characterization of vegetative and productive agronomic 
parameters compared to traditional NDVI based on spectral response of the canopy 
top. Furthermore, considering grape production as a key parameter directly 
linked to the economic profit of farmers, this study provides a deeper analysis 
focused on the development of a rapid yield forecast methodology based on UAV 
data, evaluating both traditional linear and machine learning regressions. Among 
the yield assessment models, one of the best results was obtained with the 
canopy thickness which showed high performance with the Gaussian process 
regression models (R2 = 0.80), while the yield prediction average accuracy of 
the best ML models reached 85.95%. The final results obtained confirm the 
feasibility of this research as a global yield model, which provided good 
performance through an accurate validation step realized in different years and 
different vineyards.

Permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) regression has been used to obtain 
machine-learned potential energy surfaces, including analytical gradients, for 
many molecules and chemical reactions. Recently, the approach has been extended 
to moderate size molecules with up to 15 atoms. The algorithm, including 
"purification of the basis," is computationally efficient for energies; however, 
we found that the recent extension to obtain analytical gradients, despite being 
a remarkable advance over previous methods, could be further improved. Here, we 
report developments to further compact a purified basis and, more significantly, 
to use the reverse differentiation approach to greatly speed up gradient 
evaluation. We demonstrate this for our recent four-body water interaction 
potential. Comparisons of training and testing precision on the MD17 database of 
energies and gradients (forces) for ethanol against numerous machine-learning 
methods, which were recently assessed by Dral and co-workers, are given. The PIP 
fits are as precise as those using these methods, but the PIP computation time 
for energy and force evaluation is shown to be 10-1000 times faster. Finally, a 
new PIP potential energy surface (PES) is reported for ethanol based on a more 
extensive dataset of energies and gradients than in the MD17 database. Diffusion 
Monte Carlo calculations that fail on MD17-based PESs are successful using the 
new PES.

In modern industries, high precision dimensional measurement plays a pivotal 
role in product inspection and sub-pixel edge detection is the core algorithm. 
Traditional interpolation and moment methods have achieved some success. 
However, those methods still have shortcomings. For example, the accuracy is 
still insufficient with the resolution limitation of the image sensor. Moreover, 
prediction results can be affected by image noise. With the recent success of 
deep learning technology, we propose a sub-pixel edge detection method based on 
convolution neural network (CNN) and bi-directional long short-term memory 
(LSTM). First, one-dimensional visual geometry group-16 (VGG-16) is employed to 
extract edge features. Then, a transformation operation is developed to generate 
sequence information. Lastly, bi-directional LSTM with fully-connected layers is 
introduced to output edge positions. Experimental results on our steel plate 
dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy and anti-noise 
ability than traditional methods.

The rise of machine learning (ML) has recently buttressed the efforts for big 
data-driven precision oncology. This study used ensemble ML for precision 
oncology in breast cancer, which is one of the most common malignancies 
worldwide with marked heterogeneity of the underlying molecular mechanisms. We 
analyzed clinical and RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (844 
patients with breast cancer and 113 healthy individuals) and the Molecular 
Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) (1784 patients 
with breast cancer and 202 healthy individuals). We evaluated six algorithms in 
the context of ensemble modeling and identified a candidate mRNA diagnostic 
panel that can differentiate patients from healthy controls, and stratify breast 
cancer into molecular subtypes. The ensemble model included 50 mRNAs and 
displayed 82.55% accuracy, 79.22% specificity, and 84.55% sensitivity in 
stratifying patients into molecular subtypes in TCGA cohort. Its performance was 
markedly higher, however, in distinguishing the basal, LumB, and Her2+ breast 
cancer subtypes from healthy individuals. In overall survival analysis, the mRNA 
panel showed a hazard ratio of 2.25 (p = 5 × 10-7) for breast cancer and was 
significantly associated with molecular pathways related to carcinogenesis. In 
conclusion, an ensemble ML approach, including 50 mRNAs, was able to stratify 
patients with different breast cancer subtypes and differentiate them from 
healthy individuals. Future prospective studies in large samples with deep 
phenotyping can help advance the ensemble ML approaches in breast cancer. 
Advanced ML methods such as ensemble learning are timely additions to the 
precision oncology research toolbox.

Precision feeding (PF) aims to provide the right amount of nutrients at the 
right time for each animal. Lactating sows generally receive the same diet, 
which either results in insufficient supply and body reserve mobilization, or 
excessive supply and high nutrient excretion. With the help of online measuring 
devices, computational methods, and smart feeders, we introduced the first PF 
decision support system (DSS) for lactating sows. Precision (PRE) and 
conventional (STD) feeding strategies were compared in commercial conditions. 
Every day each PRE sow received a tailored ration that had been computed by the 
DSS. This ration was obtained by blending a diet with a high AA and mineral 
content (13.00 g/kg SID Lys, 4.50 g/kg digestible P) and a diet low in AAs and 
minerals (6.50 g/kg SID Lys, 2.90 g/kg digestible P). All STD sows received a 
conventional diet (10.08 g/kg SID Lys, 3.78 g/kg digestible P). Before the 
trial, the DSS was fitted to farm performance for the prediction of piglet 
average daily gain (PADG) and sow daily feed intake (DFI), with data from 1,691 
and 3,712 lactations, respectively. Sow and litter performance were analyzed for 
the effect of feeding strategy with ANOVA, with results considered statistically 
significant when P < 0.05. The experiment involved 239 PRE and 240 STD sows. DFI 
was similarly high in both treatments (PRE: 6.59, STD: 6.45 kg/d; P = 0.11). 
Litter growth was high (PRE: 2.96, STD: 3.06 kg/d), although it decreased 
slightly by about 3% in PRE compared to STD treatments (P < 0.05). Sow body 
weight loss was low, although it was slightly higher in PRE sows (7.7 vs. 2.1 
kg, P < 0.001), which might be due to insufficient AA supply in some sows. 
Weaning to estrus interval (5.6 d) did not differ. In PRE sows SID Lys intake 
(PRE: 7.7, STD: 10.0 g/kg; P < 0.001) and digestible P intake (PRE: 3.2, STD: 
3.8 g/kg; P < 0.001) declined by 23% and 14%, respectively, and feed cost 
decreased by 12%. For PRE sows, excretion of N and P decreased by 28% and 42%, 
respectively. According to these results, PF appears to be a very promising 
strategy for lactating sows.

Plain Language Summary: In lactating sows, nutrient requirements among 
individual animals vary greatly. With a single diet, lactating sows are likely 
to be either underfed, which results in body reserve mobilization, or overfed, 
which results in nutrient excretion. Precision feeding (PF) is a new feeding 
strategy that aims to provide the right amount of nutrients at the right time 
for each animal. In this study, we focus on the implementation and the 
evaluation of a decision support system (DSS) that delivers daily tailored diets 
to lactating sows. Two experimental treatments were compared: a precision 
feeding strategy based on the DSS (PRE treatment; 239 sows), and a conventional 
feeding strategy (STD treatment; 240 sows). Digestible lysine intake and 
digestible phosphorus intake were reduced by 23% and 14% in PRE sows, 
respectively, and feed cost by 12%, compared to STD sows. Excretion of nitrogen 
and phosphorus also decreased for PRE sows by 28% and 42%, respectively. Sow 
body weight loss was low, although slightly higher in PRE sows, which might be 
due to insufficient amino acid supply in some sows. PF appears to be a very 
promising strategy for matching nutrient supply to the specific nutrient 
requirements of lactating sows.

The reliable prediction of the affinity of candidate peptides for the MHC is 
important for predicting their potential antigenicity and thus influences 
medical applications, such as decisions on their inclusion in T cell-based 
vaccines. In this study, we present a rapid, predictive computational approach 
that combines a popular, sequence-based artificial neural network method, 
NetMHCpan 4.0, with three-dimensional structural modeling. We find that the 
ensembles of bound peptide conformations generated by the programs MODELLER and 
Rosetta FlexPepDock are less variable in geometry for strong binders than for 
low-affinity peptides. In tests on 1271 peptide sequences for which the 
experimental dissociation constants of binding to the well-characterized murine 
MHC allele H-2Db are known, by applying thresholds for geometric fluctuations 
the structure-based approach in a standalone manner drastically improves the 
statistical specificity, reducing the number of false positives. Furthermore, 
filtering candidates generated with NetMHCpan 4.0 with the structure-based 
predictor led to an increase in the positive predictive value (PPV) of the 
peptides correctly predicted to bind very strongly (i.e., K d < 100 nM) from 40 
to 52% (p = 0.027). The combined method also significantly improved the PPV when 
tested on five human alleles, including some with limited data for training. 
Overall, an average increase of 10% in the PPV was found over the standalone 
sequence-based method. The combined method should be useful in the rapid design 
of effective T cell-based vaccines.

Less than half of all hypertensive patients receiving treatment are successful 
in normalizing their blood pressure. Despite the complexity and heterogeneity of 
hypertension, the current antihypertensive guidelines are not tailored to the 
individual patient. As a step toward individualized treatment, we develop a 
quantitative systems pharmacology model of blood pressure regulation in the 
spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and generate sex-specific virtual 
populations of SHRs to account for the heterogeneity between the sexes and 
within the pathophysiology of hypertension. We then used the mechanistic model 
integrated with machine learning tools to study how variability in these 
mechanisms leads to differential responses in rodents to the four primary 
classes of antihypertensive drugs. We found that both the sex and the 
pathophysiological profile of the individual play a major role in the response 
to hypertensive treatments. These results provide insight into potential areas 
to apply precision medicine in human primary hypertension.

INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children can be associated with 
poor outcome in crucial functional domains, including motor, neurocognitive and 
behavioural functioning. However, outcome varies between patients and is 
mediated by complex interplay between demographic factors, premorbid functioning 
and (sub)acute clinical characteristics. At present, methods to understand let 
alone predict outcome on the basis of these variables are lacking, which 
contributes to unnecessary follow-up as well as undetected impairments in 
children. Therefore, this study aims to develop prognostic models for the 
individual outcome of children with TBI in a range of important developmental 
domains. In addition, the potential added value of advanced neuroimaging data 
and the use of machine learning algorithms in the development of prognostic 
models will be assessed.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 210 children aged 4-18 years diagnosed with mild-to-severe 
TBI will be prospectively recruited from a research network of Dutch hospitals. 
They will be matched 2:1 to a control group of neurologically healthy children 
(n=105). Predictors in the model will include demographic, premorbid and 
clinical measures prospectively registered from the TBI hospital admission 
onwards as well as MRI metrics assessed at 1 month post-injury. Outcome measures 
of the prognostic models are (1) motor functioning, (2) intelligence, (3) 
behavioural functioning and (4) school performance, all assessed at 6 months 
post-injury.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics has been obtained from the Medical Ethical 
Board of the Amsterdam UMC (location AMC). Findings of our multicentre 
prospective study will enable clinicians to identify TBI children at risk and 
aim towards a personalised prognosis. Lastly, findings will be submitted for 
publication in open access, international and peer-reviewed journals.

Mobile manipulation, which has more flexibility than fixed-base manipulation, 
has always been an important topic in the field of robotics. However, for 
sophisticated operation in complex environments, efficient localization and 
dynamic tracking grasp still face enormous challenges. To address these 
challenges, this paper proposes a mobile manipulation method integrating 
laser-reflector-enhanced adaptive Monte Carlo localization (AMCL) algorithm and 
a dynamic tracking and grasping algorithm. First, by fusing the information of 
laser-reflector landmarks to adjust the weight of particles in AMCL, the 
localization accuracy of mobile platforms can be improved. Second, 
deep-learning-based multiple-object detection and visual servo are exploited to 
efficiently track and grasp dynamic objects. Then, a mobile manipulation system 
integrating the above two algorithms into a robotic with a 6-degrees-of-freedom 
(DOF) operation arm is implemented in an indoor environment. Technical 
components, including localization, multiple-object detection, dynamic tracking 
grasp, and the integrated system, are all verified in real-world scenarios. 
Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our method.

We broaden the applicability of sparse coding, a machine learning method, to 
low-dose electron holography by using simulated holograms for learning and 
validation processes. The holograms, with shot noise, are prepared to generate a 
model, or a dictionary, that includes basic features representing interference 
fringes. The dictionary is applied to sparse representations of other simulated 
holograms with various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Results demonstrate that 
this approach successfully removes noise for holograms with an extremely small 
SNR of 0.10, and that the denoised holograms provide the accurate phase 
distribution. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the dictionary learned 
from the simulated holograms can be applied to denoising of experimental 
holograms of a p-n junction specimen recorded with different exposure times. The 
results indicate that the simulation-trained sparse coding is suitable for use 
over a wide range of imaging conditions, in particular for observing electron 
beam-sensitive materials.

Background: To date, in personalized medicine approaches, single-cell analyses 
such as circulating tumour cells (CTC) are able to reveal small structural cell 
modifications, and therefore can retrieve several biophysical cell properties, 
such as the cell dimension, the dimensional relationship between the nucleus and 
the cytoplasm and the optical density of cellular sub-compartments. On this 
basis, we present in this study a new morphological measurement approach for the 
detection of vital CTC from pleural washing in individual non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) patients. Materials and methods: After a diagnosis of pulmonary 
malignancy, pleural washing was collected from nine NSCLC patients. The 
collected samples were processed with a density gradient separation process. 
Light scattering analysis was performed on a single cell. The results of this 
analysis were used to obtain the cell's biophysical pattern and, later on, as 
basis for Machine Learning (ML) on unknown samples. Results: Morphological 
single-cell analysis followed by ML show a predictive picture for an NSCLC 
patient, screening that it is possible to distinguish CTC from other cells. 
Moreover, we find that the proposed measurement approach was fast, reliable, 
label-free, identifying and count CTC in a biological fluid. Conclusions: Our 
findings demonstrate that CTC Biophysical Profile by Pure Light Scattering in 
NSCLC could be used as a promising diagnostic candidate in NSCLC patients.

INTRODUCTION: The complex pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases (AIDs) is being 
progressively deciphered, providing evidence for a multiplicity of 
pro-inflammatory pathways underlying heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and 
disease evolution.
AREAS COVERED: Treatment strategies involving drug combinations are emerging as 
a preferred option to achieve remission in a vast majority of patients affected 
by systemic AIDs. The design of appropriate drug combinations can benefit from 
AID modeling following a comprehensive multi-omics molecular profiling of 
patients combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered computational 
analyses. Such disease models support patient stratification in homogeneous 
subgroups, shed light on dysregulated pro-inflammatory pathways and yield 
hypotheses regarding potential therapeutic targets and candidate biomarkers to 
stratify and monitor patients during treatment. AID models inform the rational 
design of combination therapies interfering with independent pro-inflammatory 
pathways related to either one of five prominent immune compartments 
contributing to the pathophysiology of AIDs, i.e. pro-inflammatory signals 
originating from tissues, innate immune mechanisms, T lymphocyte activation, 
autoantibodies and B cell activation, as well as soluble mediators involved in 
immune cross-talk.
EXPERT OPINION: The optimal management of AIDs in the future will rely upon 
rationally designed combination therapies, as a modality of a model-based 
Computational Precision Medicine taking into account the patients' biological 
and clinical specificities.

In this paper, we studied the possibility of increasing the Brillouin frequency 
shift (BFS) detection accuracy in distributed fibre-optic sensors by the 
separate and joint use of different algorithms for finding the spectral maximum: 
Lorentzian curve fitting (LCF, including the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method), 
the backward correlation technique (BWC) and a machine learning algorithm, the 
generalized linear model (GLM). The study was carried out on real spectra 
subjected to the subsequent addition of extreme digital noise. The precision and 
accuracy of the LM and BWC methods were studied by varying the signal-to-noise 
ratios (SNRs) and by incorporating the GLM method into the processing steps. It 
was found that the use of methods in sequence gives a gain in the accuracy of 
determining the sensor temperature from tenths to several degrees Celsius (or 
MHz in BFS scale), which is manifested for signal-to-noise ratios within 0 to 20 
dB. We have found out that the double processing (BWC + GLM) is more effective 
for positive SNR values (in dB): it gives a gain in BFS measurement precision 
near 0.4 °C (428 kHz or 9.3 με); for BWC + GLM, the difference of precisions 
between single and double processing for SNRs below 2.6 dB is about 1.5 °C (1.6 
MHz or 35 με). In this case, double processing is more effective for all SNRs. 
The described technique's potential application in structural health monitoring 
(SHM) of concrete objects and different areas in metrology and sensing were also 
discussed.

Precision medicine can be defined as the comparison of a new patient with 
existing patients that have similar characteristics and can be referred to as 
patient similarity. Several deep learning models have been used to build and 
apply patient similarity networks (PSNs). However, the challenges related to 
data heterogeneity and dimensionality make it difficult to use a single model to 
reduce data dimensionality and capture the features of diverse data types. In 
this paper, we propose a multi-model PSN that considers heterogeneous static and 
dynamic data. The combination of deep learning models and PSN allows ample 
clinical evidence and information extraction against which similar patients can 
be compared. We use the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers 
(BERT) to analyze the contextual data and generate word embedding, where 
semantic features are captured using a convolutional neural network (CNN). 
Dynamic data are analyzed using a long-short-term-memory (LSTM)-based 
autoencoder, which reduces data dimensionality and preserves the temporal 
features of the data. We propose a data fusion approach combining temporal and 
clinical narrative data to estimate patient similarity. The experiments we 
conducted proved that our model provides a higher classification accuracy in 
determining various patient health outcomes when compared with other traditional 
classification algorithms.

We present a parametric physics-informed neural network for the simulation of 
personalised left-ventricular biomechanics. The neural network is constrained to 
the biophysical problem in two ways: (i) the network output is restricted to a 
subspace built from radial basis functions capturing characteristic deformations 
of left ventricles and (ii) the cost function used for training is the energy 
potential functional specifically tailored for hyperelastic, anisotropic, 
nearly-incompressible active materials. The radial bases are generated from the 
results of a nonlinear Finite Element model coupled with an anatomical shape 
model derived from high-resolution cardiac images. We show that, by coupling the 
neural network with a simplified circulation model, we can efficiently generate 
computationally inexpensive estimations of cardiac mechanics. Our model is 30 
times faster than the reference Finite Element model used, including training 
time, while yielding satisfactory average errors in the predictions of ejection 
fraction (-3%), peak systolic pressure (7%), stroke work (4%) and myocardial 
strains (14%). This physics-informed neural network is well suited to 
efficiently augment cardiac images with functional data and to generate large 
sets of synthetic cases for training deep network classifiers while it provides 
efficient personalization to the specific patient of interest with a high level 
of detail.

Raman spectroscopy, as a label-free detection technology, has been widely used 
in tumor diagnosis. However, most tumor diagnosis procedures utilize 
multivariate statistical analysis methods for classification, which poses a 
major bottleneck toward achieving high accuracy. Here, we propose a concept 
called the two-dimensional (2D) Raman figure combined with convolutional neural 
network (CNN) to improve the accuracy. Two-dimensional Raman figures can be 
obtained from four transformation methods: spectral recurrence plot (SRP), 
spectral Gramian angular field (SGAF), spectral short-time Fourier transform 
(SSTFT), and spectral Markov transition field (SMTF). Two-dimensional CNN models 
all yield more than 95% accuracy, which is higher than the PCA-LDA method and 
the Raman-spectrum-CNN method, indicating that 2D Raman figure inputs combined 
with CNN may be one reason for gaining excellent performances. Among 2D-CNN 
models, the main difference is the conversion, where SRP is based on the 
structure of wavenumber series with the best performances (98.9% accuracy, 99.5% 
sensitivity, 98.3% specificity), followed by SGAF on the wavenumber series, 
SSTFT on wavenumber and intensity information, and SMTF on wavenumber position 
information. The inclusion of external information in the conversion may be 
another reason for improvement in the accuracy. The excellent capability shows 
huge potential for tumor diagnosis via 2D Raman figures and may be applied in 
other spectroscopy analytical fields.

Conceptually, precision medicine is a deep dive to discover disease origin at 
the molecular or genetic level, thus providing insights that allow clinicians to 
design corresponding individualized patient therapies. We know that a disease 
state is created by not only certain molecular derangements but also a biologic 
milieu promoting the expression of such derangements. These factors together 
lead to manifested symptoms. At the level of molecular definition, every 
average, "similar" individual stands to be "dissimilar." Hence, there is the 
need for customized therapy, moving away from therapy based on aggregate 
statistics. The perioperative state is a mix of several, simultaneously active 
molecular mechanisms, surgical insult, drugs, severe inflammatory response, and 
the body's continuous adaptation to maintain a state of homeostasis. 
Postoperative outcomes are a net result of several of those rapid genetic and 
molecular transformations that do or do not ensue. With the advent and advances 
of artificial intelligence, the translation from identifying these intricate 
mechanisms to implementing them in clinical practice has made a huge leap. 
Precision medicine is gaining ground with the help of personalized health 
recorders and personal devices that identify disease mechanics, patient-reported 
outcomes, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interaction at the individual 
level in a closed-loop feedback system. This phenomenon is especially true given 
increasing surgeries in older adults, many of whom are on multiple medications 
and varyingly frail. In this era of precision medicine, to provide a 
comprehensive remedy, the perioperative surgical home must expand, incorporating 
not only clinicians but also basic science experts and data scientists.

An evident underestimation of the targeted prevention of dental diseases is 
strongly supported by alarming epidemiologic statistics globally. For example, 
epidemiologists demonstrated 100% prevalence of dental caries in the Russian 
population followed by clinical manifestation of periodontal diseases. 
Inadequately provided oral health services in populations are caused by 
multi-factorial deficits including but not limited to low socio-economic status 
of affected individuals, lack of insurance in sub-populations, insufficient 
density of dedicated medical units. Another important aspect is the 
"participatory" medicine based on the active participation of population in 
maintaining oral health: healthcare will remain insufficient as long as the 
patient is not motivated and does not feel responsible for their oral health. To 
this end, nearly half of chronically diseased people do not comply with adequate 
medical services suffering from severely progressing pathologies. Noteworthy, 
the prominent risk factors and comorbidities linked to the severe disease course 
and poor outcomes in COVID-19-infected individuals, such as elderly, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, are frequently associated 
with significantly altered oral microbiome profiles, systemic inflammatory 
processes and poor oral health. Suggested pathomechanisms consider potential 
preferences in the interaction between the viral particles and the host 
microbiota including oral cavity, the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. 
Since an aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria induces the expression of 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and production of 
inflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract, poor oral hygiene and 
periodontal disease have been proposed as leading to COVID-19 aggravation. 
Consequently, the issue-dedicated expert recommendations are focused on the 
optimal oral hygiene as being crucial for improved individual outcomes and 
reduced morbidity under the COVID-19 pandemic condition. Current study 
demonstrated that age, gender, socio-economic status, quality of environment and 
life-style, oral hygiene quality, regularity of dental services requested, level 
of motivation and responsibility for own health status and corresponding 
behavioural patterns are the key parameters for the patient stratification 
considering person-tailored approach in a complex dental care in the population. 
Consequently, innovative screening programmes and adapted treatment schemes are 
crucial for the complex person-tailored dental care to improve individual 
outcomes and healthcare provided to the population.

Nitrogen (N) is the most limiting nutrient for turfgrass growth. Few tools or 
soil tests exist to help managers guide N fertilizer decisions. Turf growth 
prediction models have the potential to be useful, but the lone turfgrass growth 
prediction model only takes into account temperature, limiting its accuracy. 
This study investigated the ability of a machine learning (ML)-based turf growth 
model using the random forest (RF) algorithm (ML-RF model) to improve creeping 
bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) putting green management by estimating 
short-term clipping yield. This method was compared against three alternative N 
application strategies including (1) PACE Turf growth potential (GP) model, (2) 
an experience-based method for applying N fertilizer (experience-based method), 
and (3) the experience-based method guided by a vegetative index, normalized 
difference red edge (NDRE)-based method. The ML-RF model was built based on a 
set of variables including 7-day weather, evapotranspiration (ET), traffic 
intensity, soil moisture content, N fertilization rate, NDRE, and root zone 
type. The field experiment was conducted on two sand-based research greens in 
2020 and 2021. The cumulative applied N fertilizer was 281 kg ha-1 for the PACE 
Turf GP model, 190 kg ha-1 for the experience-based method, 140 kg ha-1 for the 
ML-RF model, and around 75 kg ha-1 NDRE-based method. ML-RF model and NDRE-based 
method were able to provide customized N fertilization recommendations on 
different root zones. The methods resulted in different mean turfgrass qualities 
and NDRE. From highest to lowest, they were PACE Turf GP model, 
experience-based, ML-RF model, and NDRE-based method, and the first three 
methods produced turfgrass quality over 7 (on a scale from 1 to 9) and NDRE 
value over 0.30. N fertilization guided by the ML-RF model resulted in a 
moderate amount of fertilizer applied and acceptable turfgrass performance 
characteristics. This application strategy is based on the N cycle and has the 
potential to assist turfgrass managers in making N fertilization decisions for 
creeping bentgrass putting greens.

BACKGROUND: Donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine are potentially 
effective interventions for cognitive impairment in dementia, but the use of 
these drugs has not been personalised to individual patients yet. We examined 
whether artificial intelligence-based recommendations can identify the best 
treatment using routinely collected patient-level information.
METHODS: Six thousand eight hundred four patients aged 59-102 years with a 
diagnosis of dementia from two National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trusts 
in the UK were used for model training/internal validation and external 
validation, respectively. A personalised prescription model based on the 
Recurrent Neural Network machine learning architecture was developed to predict 
the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA) scores post-drug initiation. The drug that resulted in the smallest 
decline in cognitive scores between prescription and the next visit was selected 
as the treatment of choice. Change of cognitive scores up to 2 years after 
treatment initiation was compared for model evaluation.
RESULTS: Overall, 1343 patients with MMSE scores were identified for internal 
validation and 285 [21.22%] took the drug recommended. After 2 years, the 
reduction of mean [standard deviation] MMSE score in this group was 
significantly smaller than the remaining 1058 [78.78%] patients (0.60 [0.26] vs 
2.80 [0.28]; P = 0.02). In the external validation cohort (N = 1772), 222 
[12.53%] patients took the drug recommended and reported a smaller MMSE 
reduction compared to the 1550 [87.47%] patients who did not (1.01 [0.49] vs 
4.23 [0.60]; P = 0.01). A similar performance gap was seen when testing the 
model on patients prescribed with AChEIs only.
CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to identify the most effective drug for the 
real-world treatment of cognitive impairment in dementia at an individual 
patient level. Routine care patients whose prescribed medications were the best 
fit according to the model had better cognitive performance after 2 years.

PREMISE: Weed removal in agriculture is typically achieved using herbicides. The 
use of autonomous robots to reduce weeds is a promising alternative solution, 
although their implementation requires the precise detection and identification 
of crops and weeds to allow an efficient action.
METHODS: We trained and evaluated an instance segmentation convolutional neural 
network aimed at segmenting and identifying each plant specimen visible in 
images produced by agricultural robots. The resulting data set comprised field 
images on which the outlines of 2489 specimens from two crop species and four 
weed species were manually drawn. We adjusted the hyperparameters of a mask 
region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) to this specific task and 
evaluated the resulting trained model.
RESULTS: The probability of detection using the model was quite good but varied 
significantly depending on the species and size of the plants. In practice, 
between 10% and 60% of weeds could be removed without too high of a risk of 
confusion with crop plants. Furthermore, we show that the segmentation of each 
plant enabled the determination of precise action points such as the barycenter 
of the plant surface.
DISCUSSION: Instance segmentation opens many possibilities for optimized weed 
removal actions. Weed electrification, for instance, could benefit from the 
targeted adjustment of the voltage, frequency, and location of the electrode to 
the plant. The results of this work will enable the evaluation of this type of 
weeding approach in the coming months.

OBJECTIVE: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), one of the main public 
health concerns in mainland China, is a group of clinically similar diseases 
caused by hantaviruses. Statistical approaches have always been leveraged to 
forecast the future incidence rates of certain infectious diseases to 
effectively control their prevalence and outbreak potential. Compared to the use 
of one base model, model stacking can often produce better forecasting results. 
In this study, we fitted the monthly reported cases of HFRS in mainland China 
with a model stacking approach and compared its forecasting performance with 
those of five base models.
METHOD: We fitted the monthly reported cases of HFRS ranging from January 2004 
to June 2019 in mainland China with an autoregressive integrated moving average 
(ARIMA) model; the Holt-Winter (HW) method, seasonal decomposition of the time 
series by LOESS (STL); a neural network autoregressive (NNAR) model; and an 
exponential smoothing state space model with a Box-Cox transformation; ARMA 
errors; and trend and seasonal components (TBATS), and we combined the 
forecasting results with the inverse rank approach. The forecasting performance 
was estimated based on several accuracy criteria for model prediction, including 
the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and 
mean absolute error (MAE).
RESULT: There was a slight downward trend and obvious seasonal periodicity 
inherent in the time series data for HFRS in mainland China. The model stacking 
method was selected as the best approach with the best performance in terms of 
both fitting (RMSE 128.19, MAE 85.63, MAPE 8.18) and prediction (RMSE 151.86, 
MAE 118.28, MAPE 13.16).
CONCLUSION: The results showed that model stacking by using the optimal mean 
forecasting weight of the five abovementioned models achieved the best 
performance in terms of predicting HFRS one year into the future. This study has 
corroborated the conclusion that model stacking is an easy way to enhance 
prediction accuracy when modeling HFRS.

Precision technology devices can measure and detect relative changes in an 
animal's behavior to possibly create alerts to intervene and to administer 
treatments. However, the association of relative changes in daily feeding and 
activity behaviors in calves with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) status is 
still largely unexplored. The objective of this case-control study was to 
determine if daily behavioral patterns of preweaning dairy calves (measured by 
precision technologies) change before BRD diagnosis. This case-control study 
enrolled 33 pairs of calves (33 BRD calves matched by age, sex, and birthdate to 
33 controls) health scored daily for BRD for the preweaning period (until 50 d 
on the automated feeder). A pedometer (IceQube, Ice Robotics) was attached to 
the left rear leg to track activity (lying time, lying bouts, total steps, and 
acceleration activity index). At 3.0 ± 2.0 d of age, calves were trained to use 
the automated feeder, which recorded milk and calf starter intake, drinking 
speed, and feeder visits. Calves were allotted a maximum 10 L/d of milk replacer 
(Cow's Match, Land O'Lakes Animal Milk Products Co.; 140 g/L) and starter 
(Special Calf Starter and Grower, Baghdad Feeds), ad libitum. Calves were scored 
daily for signs of BRD using the Wisconsin scoring system, and their lungs were 
scored with ultrasonography twice weekly. Outward signs of BRD as defined by the 
Wisconsin scoring system and an area of consolidated lung ≥3.0 cm2 was 
identified as BRD (d 0). Relative changes in daily behaviors were calculated 
using d -5 before BRD diagnosis as the baseline for each calf for each behavior. 
Linear mixed models were used to investigate the association of BRD status with 
feeding behaviors, activity, and relative changes in calf behavior over a 5-d 
period before diagnosis, as well as the BRD status × day interaction. Calves 
with a BRD bout were diagnosed at an average age of 33.0 ± 9.0 d (mean ± 
standard deviation) and weighed 56.1 ± 9.7 kg. Over the period, BRD calves had 
reduced milk and starter intake, greater lying times, and fewer lying bouts, 
step counts, and activity indices when compared with healthy calves. 
Furthermore, there was a BRD status × day interaction for relative changes in 
unrewarded visits, and relative changes in calf starter intake. Specifically, 
BRD calves had a decline in relative changes in their unrewarded visits on d -4, 
-2, -1, and 0 compared with healthy calves. This study suggests that there is 
the potential to use feeding and activity behaviors to identify BRD development 
in preweaning calves. However, utilization of an animals' daily behavioral 
patterns in real time is fundamental for developing disease detection 
algorithms, thus we suggest relative changes in unrewarded visits may be useful 
for algorithm development when d -5 is used as a baseline. Future research 
should investigate the potential of feeding behavior and activity levels 
collectively to indicate BRD status in calves using machine learning techniques.

3D printed drug delivery systems have gained tremendous attention in 
pharmaceutical research due to their inherent benefits over conventional 
systems, such as provisions for customized design and personalized dosing. The 
present study demonstrates a novel approach of drop-on-demand (DoD) droplet 
deposition to dispense drug solutions precisely on binder jetting-based 3D 
printed multi-compartment tablets containing 3 model anti-viral drugs 
(hydroxychloroquine sulfate - HCS, ritonavir and favipiravir). The printing 
pressure affected the printing quality whereas the printing speed and infill 
density significantly impacted the volume dispersed on the tablets. 
Additionally, the DoD parameters such as nozzle valve open time and cycle time 
affected both dispersing volume and the uniformity of the tablets. The 
solid-state characterization, including DSC, XRD, and PLM, revealed that all 
drugs remained in their crystalline forms. Advanced surface analysis conducted 
by microCT imaging as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Deep Learning (DL) 
model validation showed a homogenous drug distribution in the printed tablets 
even at ultra-low doses. For a four-hour in vitro drug release study, the drug 
loaded in the outer layer was released over 90%, and the drug incorporated in 
the middle layer was released over 70%. In contrast, drug encapsulated in the 
core was only released about 40%, indicating that outer and middle layers were 
suitable for immediate release while the core could be applied for 
delayed release. Overall, this study demonstrates a great potential for 
tailoring drug release rates from a customized modular dosage form and 
developing personalized drug delivery systems coupling different 3D printing 
techniques.

In the precision medicine era, there is a growing need for precision 
radiotherapy where the planned radiation dose needs to be optimally determined 
by considering a myriad of patient-specific information in order to ensure 
treatment efficacy. Existing artificial-intelligence (AI) methods can recommend 
radiation dose prescriptions within the scope of this available information. 
However, treating physicians may not fully entrust the AI's recommended 
prescriptions due to known limitations or at instances when the AI 
recommendation may go beyond physicians' current knowledge. This paper lays out 
a systematic method to integrate expert human knowledge with AI recommendations 
for optimizing clinical decision making. Towards this goal, Gaussian process 
(GP) models are integrated with deep neural networks (DNNs) to quantify the 
uncertainty of the treatment outcomes given by physicians and AI 
recommendations, respectively, which are further used as a guideline to educate 
clinical physicians and improve AI models performance. The proposed method is 
demonstrated in a comprehensive dataset where patient-specific information and 
treatment outcomes are prospectively collected during radiotherapy of 67 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and are retrospectively analyzed.

Early diagnosis of urological diseases is often difficult due to the lack of 
specific biomarkers. More powerful and less invasive biomarkers that can be used 
simultaneously to identify urological diseases could improve patient outcomes. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate a urological disease-specific scoring 
system established with a machine learning (ML) approach using Ig N-glycan 
signatures. Immunoglobulin N-glycan signatures were analyzed by capillary 
electrophoresis from 1312 serum subjects with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
(n = 234), castration-resistant prostate cancer (n = 94), renal cell carcinoma 
(n = 100), upper urinary tract urothelial cancer (n = 105), bladder cancer 
(n = 176), germ cell tumors (n = 73), benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 95), 
urosepsis (n = 145), and urinary tract infection (n = 21) as well as healthy 
volunteers (n = 269). Immunoglobulin N-glycan signature data were used in a 
supervised-ML model to establish a scoring system that gave the probability of 
the presence of a urological disease. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The 
supervised-ML urologic disease-specific scores clearly discriminated the 
urological diseases (AUC 0.78-1.00) and found a distinct N-glycan pattern that 
contributed to detect each disease. Limitations included the retrospective and 
limited pathological information regarding urological diseases. The 
supervised-ML urological disease-specific scoring system based on Ig N-glycan 
signatures showed excellent diagnostic ability for nine urological diseases 
using a one-time serum collection and could be a promising approach for the 
diagnosis of urological diseases.

We introduced a novel protocol based on an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted 
analytic system for facial expressions, Customized Precision Facial Assessment 
(CPFA), to evaluate and quantify the microexpressions of aesthetic concern. With 
the help of CPFA, physicians may be able to conduct static and dynamic 
assessments for the microexpressions of the ir patients and perform quantitative 
measurements before and after the treatments. Through the detection of 
microexpressions and its active action units of facial muscles, physicians are 
more likely to optimize the treatment with minimal intervention by precise 
localization of the foci of aesthetic concern. We presented 3 cases who received 
neuromodulators and injectable fillers, and we showed the differences in the 
area of treatment and outcomes of procedures between the CPFA-oriented 
treatments and human-facilitated ones. We found negative facial expressions 
decreased in all 3 cases in the group of CPFA while they decreased in only case 
1 and case 2 in the group of human facilitated treatment. The CPFA group has 
more significant decrease in negative facial expression scores than the human 
group. This pilot study demonstrates that CPFA can objectively recognize and 
quantify the facial action units associated with negative emotions, and the 
physician may be able to customize the treatment for individuals accordingly 
with promising results.

BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is a major global health challenge, the leading cause 
of death in children under 5 years of age, and a key measure of a population's 
general health and nutritional status. Current clinical methods of estimating 
fetal gestational age are often inaccurate. For example, between 20 and 30 weeks 
of gestation, the width of the 95% prediction interval around the actual 
gestational age is estimated to be 18-36 days, even when the best ultrasound 
estimates are used. The aims of this study are to improve estimates of fetal 
gestational age and provide personalised predictions of future growth.
METHODS: Using ultrasound-derived, fetal biometric data, we developed a machine 
learning approach to accurately estimate gestational age. The accuracy of the 
method is determined by reference to exactly known facts pertaining to each 
fetus-specifically, intervals between ultrasound visits-rather than the date of 
the mother's last menstrual period. The data stem from a sample of healthy, 
well-nourished participants in a large, multicentre, population-based study, the 
International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century 
(INTERGROWTH-21st). The generalisability of the algorithm is shown with data 
from a different and more heterogeneous population (INTERBIO-21st Fetal Study).
FINDINGS: In the context of two large datasets, we estimated gestational age 
between 20 and 30 weeks of gestation with 95% confidence to within 3 days, using 
measurements made in a 10-week window spanning the second and third trimesters. 
Fetal gestational age can thus be estimated in the 20-30 weeks gestational age 
window with a prediction interval 3-5 times better than with any previous 
algorithm. This will enable improved management of individual pregnancies. 
6-week forecasts of the growth trajectory for a given fetus are accurate to 
within 7 days. This will help identify at-risk fetuses more accurately than 
currently possible. At population level, the higher accuracy is expected to 
improve fetal growth charts and population health assessments.
INTERPRETATION: Machine learning can circumvent long-standing limitations in 
determining fetal gestational age and future growth trajectory, without recourse 
to often inaccurately known information, such as the date of the mother's last 
menstrual period. Using this algorithm in clinical practice could facilitate the 
management of individual pregnancies and improve population-level health. Upon 
publication of this study, the algorithm for gestational age estimates will be 
provided for research purposes free of charge via a web portal.

Cancer is one of the major causes of human disease and death worldwide, and 
mammary cancer is one of the most common cancer types among women today. In this 
paper, we used the deep learning method to conduct a preliminary experiment on 
Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis); BreakHis is an open 
dataset. We propose a high-precision classification method of mammary based on 
an improved convolutional neural network on the BreakHis dataset. We proposed 
three different MFSCNET models according to the different insertion positions 
and the number of SE modules, respectively, MFSCNet A, MFSCNet B, and MFSCNet C. 
We carried out experiments on the BreakHis dataset. Through experimental 
comparison, especially, the MFSCNet A network model has obtained the best 
performance in the high-precision classification experiments of mammary cancer. 
The accuracy of dichotomy was 99.05% to 99.89%. The accuracy of multiclass 
classification ranges from 94.36% to approximately 98.41%.Therefore, it is 
proved that MFSCNet can accurately classify the mammary histological images and 
has a great application prospect in predicting the degree of tumor. Code will be 
made available on http://github.com/xiaoan-maker/MFSCNet.

Measuring joint kinematics is a key requirement for a plethora of biomechanical 
research and applications. While x-ray based systems avoid the soft-tissue 
artefacts arising in skin-based measurement systems, extracting the object's 
pose (translation and rotation) from the x-ray images is a time-consuming and 
expensive task. Based on about 106'000 annotated images of knee implants, 
collected over the last decade with our moving fluoroscope during activities of 
daily living, we trained a deep-learning model to automatically estimate the 6D 
poses for the femoral and tibial implant components. By pretraining a single 
stage of our architecture using renderings of the implant geometries, our 
approach offers personalised predictions of the implant poses, even for unseen 
subjects. Our approach predicted the pose of both implant components better than 
about 0.75 mm (in-plane translation), 25 mm (out-of-plane translation), and 2° 
(all Euler-angle rotations) over 50% of the test samples. When evaluating over 
90% of test samples, which included heavy occlusions and low contrast images, 
translation performance was better than 1.5 mm (in-plane) and 30 mm 
(out-of-plane), while rotations were predicted better than 3-4°. Importantly, 
this approach now allows for pose estimation in a fully automated manner.

BACKGROUND: Recognising the early signs of ischemic stroke (IS) in emergency 
settings has been challenging. Machine learning (ML), a robust tool for 
predictive, preventive and personalised medicine (PPPM/3PM), presents a possible 
solution for this issue and produces accurate predictions for real-time data 
processing.
METHODS: This investigation evaluated 4999 IS patients among a total of 10,476 
adults included in the initial dataset, and 1076 IS subjects among 3935 
participants in the external validation dataset. Six ML-based models for the 
prediction of IS were trained on the initial dataset of 10,476 participants 
(split participants into a training set [80%] and an internal validation set 
[20%]). Selected clinical laboratory features routinely assessed at admission 
were used to inform the models. Model performance was mainly evaluated by the 
area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve. Additional 
techniques-permutation feature importance (PFI), local interpretable 
model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanations 
(SHAP)-were applied for explaining the black-box ML models.
RESULTS: Fifteen routine haematological and biochemical features were selected 
to establish ML-based models for the prediction of IS. The XGBoost-based model 
achieved the highest predictive performance, reaching AUCs of 0.91 (0.90-0.92) 
and 0.92 (0.91-0.93) in the internal and external datasets respectively. PFI 
globally revealed that demographic feature age, routine haematological 
parameters, haemoglobin and neutrophil count, and biochemical analytes total 
protein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were more influential on the 
model's prediction. LIME and SHAP showed similar local feature attribution 
explanations.
CONCLUSION: In the context of PPPM/3PM, we used the selected predictors obtained 
from the results of common blood tests to develop and validate ML-based models 
for the diagnosis of IS. The XGBoost-based model offers the most accurate 
prediction. By incorporating the individualised patient profile, this prediction 
tool is simple and quick to administer. This is promising to support subjective 
decision making in resource-limited settings or primary care, thereby shortening 
the time window for the treatment, and improving outcomes after IS.

In recent decades, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained considerable 
popularity in the agricultural sector, in which UAV-based actuation is used to 
spray pesticides and release biological control agents. A key challenge in such 
UAV-based actuation is to account for wind speed and UAV flight parameters to 
maximize precision-delivery of pesticides and biological control agents. This 
paper describes a data-driven framework to predict density distribution patterns 
of vermiculite dispensed from a hovering UAV as a function of UAV's movement 
state, wind condition, and dispenser setting. The model, derived by our proposed 
learning algorithm, is able to accurately predict the vermiculite distribution 
pattern evaluated in terms of both training and test data. Our framework and 
algorithm can be easily translated to other precision pest management problems 
with different UAVs and dispensers and for difference pesticides and crops. 
Moreover, our model, due to its simple analytical form, can be incorporated into 
the design of a controller that can optimize autonomous UAV delivery of desired 
amount of predatory mites to multiple target locations.

BACKGROUND: Determination of the total number and size of all pulmonary 
metastases on chest CT is time-consuming and as such has been understudied as an 
independent metric for disease assessment. A novel artificial intelligence (AI) 
model may allow for automated detection, size determination, and quantification 
of the number of pulmonary metastases on chest CT.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of a novel AI program applied to initial 
staging chest CT in breast cancer patients in risk assessment of mortality and 
survival.
METHODS: Retrospective imaging data from a cohort of 226 subjects with breast 
cancer was assessed by the novel AI program and the results validated by blinded 
readers. Mean clinical follow-up was 2.5 years for outcomes including 
cancer-related death and development of extrapulmonary metastatic disease. AI 
measurements including total number of pulmonary metastases and maximum nodule 
size were assessed by Cox-proportional hazard modeling and adjusted survival.
RESULTS: 752 lung nodules were identified by the AI program, 689 of which were 
identified in 168 subjects having confirmed lung metastases (Lmet+) and 63 were 
identified in 58 subjects without confirmed lung metastases (Lmet-). When 
compared to the reader assessment, AI had a per-patient sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV and NPV of 0.952, 0.639, 0.878, and 0.830. Mortality in the 
Lmet + group was four times greater compared to the Lmet-group (p = 0.002). In a 
multivariate analysis, total lung nodule count by AI had a high correlation with 
overall mortality (OR 1.11 (range 1.07-1.15), p < 0.001) with an AUC of 0.811 
(R2 = 0.226, p < 0.0001). When total lung nodule count and maximum nodule 
diameter were combined there was an AUC of 0.826 (R2 = 0.243, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Automated AI-based detection of lung metastases in breast cancer 
patients at initial staging chest CT performed well at identifying pulmonary 
metastases and demonstrated strong correlation between the total number and 
maximum size of lung metastases with future mortality.
CLINICAL IMPACT: As a component of precision medicine, AI-based measurements at 
the time of initial staging may improve prediction of which breast cancer 
patients will have negative future outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Computational fractional flow reserve (FFR) was recently developed 
to expand the use of physiology-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 
Nevertheless, current methods do not account for plaque composition. It remains 
unknown whether the numerical precision of computational FFR is impacted by the 
plaque composition in the interrogated vessels.
METHODS: This study is an observational, retrospective, cross-sectional study. 
Patients who underwent both optical coherence tomography (OCT) and FFR prior to 
intervention between August 2011 and October 2018 at Wakayama Medical University 
Hospital were included. All frames from OCT pullbacks were analyzed using a deep 
learning algorithm to obtain coronary plaque morphology including thin-cap 
fibroatheroma (TCFA), lipidic plaque volume (LPV), fibrous plaque volume (FPV), 
and calcific plaque volume (CPV). The interrogated vessels were stratified into 
three subgroups: the overestimation group with the numerical difference between 
the optical flow ratio (OFR) and FFR >0.05, the reference group with the 
difference ≥-0.05 and ≤0.05, and the underestimation group with the difference 
<-0.05.
RESULTS: In total 230 vessels with intermediate coronary artery stenosis from 
193 patients were analyzed. The mean FFR was 0.82±0.10. Among them, 21, 179, and 
30 vessels were in the overestimation, the reference, and the underestimation 
group, respectively. TCFA was higher in the underestimation group (60%) compared 
with reference (36.3%) and overestimation group (19%). Besides, it was not 
associated with numerical difference between OFR and FFR (NDOF) after multilevel 
linear regression. LPV was associated with NDOF as OFR underestimated FFR with 
-0.028 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.047, -0.009] for every 100 mm3 increase 
in LPV.
CONCLUSIONS: High lipid burden underestimates FFR when OFR is used to assess the 
hemodynamic importance of intermediate coronary artery stenosis. TCFA, FPV, and 
CPV were not independent predictors of NDOF.

BACKGROUND: Stroke is one of the most frequent diseases, and half of the stroke 
survivors are left with permanent impairment. Prediction of individual outcome 
is still difficult. Many but not all patients with stroke improve by 
approximately 1.7 times the initial impairment, that has been termed 
proportional recovery rule. The present study aims at identifying factors 
predicting motor outcome after stroke more accurately than before, and observe 
associations of rehabilitation treatment with outcome.
METHODS: The study is designed as a multi-centre prospective clinical 
observational trial. An extensive primary data set of clinical, neuroimaging, 
electrophysiological, and laboratory data will be collected within 96 h of 
stroke onset from patients with relevant upper extremity deficit, as indexed by 
a Fugl-Meyer-Upper Extremity (FM-UE) score ≤ 50. At least 200 patients will be 
recruited. Clinical scores will include the FM-UE score (range 0-66, unimpaired 
function is indicated by a score of 66), Action Research Arm Test, modified 
Rankin Scale, Barthel Index and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale. Follow-up 
clinical scores and applied types and amount of rehabilitation treatment will be 
documented in the rehabilitation hospitals. Final follow-up clinical scoring 
will be performed 90 days after the stroke event. The primary endpoint is the 
change in FM-UE defined as 90 days FM-UE minus initial FM-UE, divided by initial 
FM-UE impairment. Changes in the other clinical scores serve as secondary 
endpoints. Machine learning methods will be employed to analyze the data and 
predict primary and secondary endpoints based on the primary data set and the 
different rehabilitation treatments.
DISCUSSION: If successful, outcome and relation to rehabilitation treatment in 
patients with acute motor stroke will be predictable more reliably than 
currently possible, leading to personalized neurorehabilitation. An important 
regulatory aspect of this trial is the first-time implementation of systematic 
patient data transfer between emergency and rehabilitation hospitals, which are 
divided institutions in Germany.

Organoid models are used to study kidney physiology, such as the assessment of 
nephrotoxicity and underlying disease processes. Personalized human pluripotent 
stem cell-derived kidney organoids are ideal models for compound toxicity 
studies, but there is a need to accelerate basic and translational research in 
the field. Here, we developed an automated continuous imaging setup with the 
"read-on-ski" law of control to maximize temporal resolution with minimum 
culture plate vibration. High-accuracy performance was achieved: organoid 
screening and imaging were performed at a spatial resolution of 1.1 μm for the 
entire multi-well plate under 3 min. We used the in-house developed multi-well 
spinning device and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity model to evaluate the 
toxicity in kidney organoids using this system. The acquired images were 
processed via machine learning-based classification and segmentation algorithms, 
and the toxicity in kidney organoids was determined with 95% accuracy. The 
results obtained by the automated "read-on-ski" imaging device, combined with 
label-free and non-invasive algorithms for detection, were verified using 
conventional biological procedures. Taking advantage of the close-to-in 
vivo-kidney organoid model, this new development opens the door for further 
application of scaled-up screening using organoids in basic research and drug 
discovery.

PURPOSE: The clinical adoption of quantitative imaging biomarkers (radiomics) 
has established the need for high quality contrast-enhancement in medical 
images. We aimed to develop a machine-learning algorithm for Quality Control of 
Contrast-Enhancement on CT-scan (CECT-QC).
METHOD: Multicenter data from four independent cohorts [A, B, C, D] of patients 
with measurable liver lesions were analyzed retrospectively 
(patients:time-points; 503:3397): [A] dynamic CTs from primary liver cancer 
(60:2359); [B] triphasic CTs from primary liver cancer (31:93); [C] triphasic 
CTs from hepatocellular carcinoma (121:363); [D] portal venous phase CTs of 
liver metastasis from colorectal cancer (291:582). Patients from cohort A were 
randomized to training-set (48:1884) and test-set (12:475). A random forest 
classifier was trained and tested to identify five contrast-enhancement phases. 
The input was the mean intensity of the abdominal aorta and the portal vein 
measured on a single abdominal CT scan image at a single time-point. The output 
to be predicted was: non-contrast [NCP], early-arterial [E-AP], optimal-arterial 
[O-AP], optimal-portal [O-PVP], and late-portal [L-PVP]. Clinical utility was 
assessed in cohorts B, C, and D.
RESULTS: The CECT-QC algorithm showed performances of 98 %, 90 %, and 84 % for 
predicting NCP, O-AP, and O-PVP, respectively. O-PVP was reached in half of 
patients and was associated with a peak in liver malignancy density. 
Contrast-enhancement quality significantly influenced radiomics features 
deciphering the phenotype of liver neoplasms.
CONCLUSIONS: A single CT-image can be used to differentiate five 
contrast-enhancement phases for radiomics-based precision medicine in the most 
common liver neoplasms occurring in patients with or without liver cirrhosis.

LncRNAs have arisen as new players in the world of non-coding RNA. Disrupted 
expression of these molecules can be tightly linked to the onset, promotion and 
progression of cancer. The present study estimated the usefulness of 14 lncRNAs 
(HAGLR, ADAMTS9-AS2, LINC00261, MCM3AP-AS1, TP53TG1, C14orf132, LINC00968, 
LINC00312, TP73-AS1, LOC344887, LINC00673, SOX2-OT, AFAP1-AS1, LOC730101) for 
early detection of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The total RNA was 
isolated from paired fresh-frozen cancerous and noncancerous lung tissue from 92 
NSCLC patients diagnosed with either adenocarcinoma (LUAD) or lung squamous cell 
carcinoma (LUSC). The expression level of lncRNAs was evaluated by a 
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Based on Ct and delta Ct values, logistic 
regression and gradient boosting decision tree classifiers were built. The 
latter is a novel, advanced machine learning algorithm with great potential in 
medical science. The established predictive models showed that a set of 14 
lncRNAs accurately discriminates cancerous from noncancerous lung tissues (AUC 
value of 0.98 ± 0.01) and NSCLC subtypes (AUC value of 0.84 ± 0.09), although 
the expression of a few molecules was statistically insignificant (SOX2-OT, 
AFAP1-AS1 and LOC730101 for tumor vs. normal tissue; and TP53TG1, C14orf132, 
LINC00968 and LOC730101 for LUAD vs. LUSC). However for subtypes discrimination, 
the simplified logistic regression model based on the four variables (delta Ct 
AFAP1-AS1, Ct SOX2-OT, Ct LINC00261, and delta Ct LINC00673) had even stronger 
diagnostic potential than the original one (AUC value of 0.88 ± 0.07). Our 
results demonstrate that the 14 lncRNA signature can be an auxiliary tool to 
endorse and complement the histological diagnosis of non-small-cell lung cancer.

Chronic diseases typically require long-term management through healthy 
lifestyle practices and pharmacological intervention. Although efficacious 
treatments exist, disease control is often sub-optimal leading to chronic 
disease-related sequela. Poor disease control can partially be explained by the 
'one size fits all' pharmacological approach. Precision medicine aims to tailor 
treatments to the individual. CURATE.AI is a dosing optimisation platform that 
considers individual factors to improve the precision of drug therapies. 
CURATE.AI has been validated in other therapeutic areas, such as cancer, but has 
yet to be applied in chronic disease care. We will evaluate the CURATE.AI system 
through a single-arm feasibility study (n = 20 hypertensives and n = 20 type II 
diabetics). Dosing decisions will be based on CURATE.AI recommendations. We will 
prospectively collect clinical and qualitative data and report on the clinical 
effect, implementation challenges, and acceptability of using CURATE.AI. In 
addition, we will explore how to enhance the algorithm further using 
retrospective patient data. For example, the inclusion of other variables, the 
simultaneous optimisation of multiple drugs, and the incorporation of other 
artificial intelligence algorithms. Overall, this project aims to understand the 
feasibility of using CURATE.AI in clinical practice. Barriers and enablers to 
CURATE.AI will be identified to inform the system's future development.

Mental health issues are at the forefront of healthcare challenges facing 
contemporary human society. These issues are most prevalent among working-age 
people, impacting negatively on the individual, his/her family, workplace, 
community, and the economy. Conventional mental healthcare services, although 
highly effective, cannot be scaled up to address the increasing demand from 
affected individuals, as evidenced in the first two years of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Conversational agents, or chatbots, are a recent technological 
innovation that has been successfully adapted for mental healthcare as a 
scalable platform of cross-platform smartphone applications that provides 
first-level support for such individuals. Despite this disposition, mental 
health chatbots in the extant literature and practice are limited in terms of 
the therapy provided and the level of personalisation. For instance, most 
chatbots extend Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) into predefined 
conversational pathways that are generic and ineffective in recurrent use. In 
this paper, we postulate that Behavioural Activation (BA) therapy and Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) are more effectively materialised in a chatbot setting to 
provide recurrent emotional support, personalised assistance, and remote mental 
health monitoring. We present the design and development of our BA-based AI 
chatbot, followed by its participatory evaluation in a pilot study setting that 
confirmed its effectiveness in providing support for individuals with mental 
health issues.

In this modern era of precision medicine, molecular signatures identified from 
advanced omics technologies hold great promise to better guide clinical 
decisions. However, current approaches are often location-specific due to the 
inherent differences between platforms and across multiple centres, thus 
limiting the transferability of molecular signatures. We present Cross-Platform 
Omics Prediction (CPOP), a penalised regression model that can use omics data to 
predict patient outcomes in a platform-independent manner and across time and 
experiments. CPOP improves on the traditional prediction framework of using 
gene-based features by selecting ratio-based features with similar estimated 
effect sizes. These components gave CPOP the ability to have a stable 
performance across datasets of similar biology, minimising the effect of 
technical noise often generated by omics platforms. We present a comprehensive 
evaluation using melanoma transcriptomics data to demonstrate its potential to 
be used as a critical part of a clinical screening framework for precision 
medicine. Additional assessment of generalisation was demonstrated with ovarian 
cancer and inflammatory bowel disease studies.

Paper, a web of interconnected cellulose fibres, is widely used as a base 
substrate. It has been applied in several applications since it features 
interesting properties, such as renewability, biodegradability, recyclability, 
affordability and mechanical flexibility. Furthermore, it offers a broad 
possibility to modify its surface properties toward specifics additives. The 
fillers retention and the fibres bonding ability are heavily affected by the 
cellulose refining process that influences chemical and morphological features 
of the fibres. Several refining theories were developed in order to determine 
the best refining conditions. However, it is not trivial to control the 
cellulose refining as different phenomena occur simultaneously. Therefore, it is 
intuitively managed by experienced papermakers to improve paper structures and 
properties. An approach based on the machine learning aimed at estimating the 
effects of refining on the fibres morphology is proposed in this study. In 
particular, an artificial neural network (ANN) was implemented and trained with 
experimental data to predict the fibres length as a function of refining process 
variables. The prediction of this parameter is crucial to obtain a 
high-performance process in terms of effectiveness and the optimisation of the 
final product performance as a function of the process parameter. To achieve 
these results, data mining of the experimental patterns collected was exploited. 
It led to the achievement of excellent performance and high accuracy in fibres 
length prediction.

Population Health Management typically relies on subjective decisions to segment 
and stratify populations. This study combines unsupervised clustering for 
segmentation and supervised classification, personalised to clusters, for 
stratification. An increase in cluster homogeneity, sensitivity and positive 
predictive value was observed compared to an unlinked approach. This analysis 
demonstrates the potential for a cluster-then-predict methodology to improve and 
personalise decisions in healthcare systems.

Fentanyl is a potent opioid analgesic with high bioavailability. It is the 
leading cause of drug addiction and overdose death. To better control the abuse 
of fentanyl and its derivatives, it is crucial to develop rapid and sensitive 
detection methods. However, fentanyl-related substrates undergo similar 
molecular structures resulting in similar properties, which are difficult to be 
identified by conventional spectroscopic methods. In this work, a method for the 
automatic identification of 8 fentanyl-related substances with similar spectral 
characteristics was developed using terahertz (THz) spectroscopy coupled with 
density functional theory (DFT) and spectral similarity mapping (SSM). To 
characterize the THz fingerprints of these fentanyl-related samples more 
accurately, the method of baseline estimation and denoising with sparsity was 
performed before revealing the unique molecular dynamics of each substance by 
DFT. The SSM method was proposed to identify these fentanyl analogs based on 
weighted spectral cosine-cross similarity and fingerprint discrete Fréchet 
distance, generating a matching list by stepwise searching the entire spectral 
database. The top matched list returned the identification results of the target 
fentanyl analogs with accuracies of 94.48~99.33%. Results from this work provide 
algorithms' increased reliability, which serves as an artificial 
intelligence-based tool for high-precision fentanyl analysis in real-world 
samples.

Counting wheat heads is a time-consuming process in agricultural production, 
which is currently primarily carried out by humans. Manually identifying wheat 
heads and statistically analyzing the findings has a rigorous requirement for 
the workforce and is prone to error. With the advancement of machine vision 
technology, computer vision detection algorithms have made wheat head detection 
and counting feasible. To accomplish this traditional labor-intensive task and 
tackle various tricky matters in wheat images, a high-precision wheat head 
detection model with strong generalizability was presented based on a one-stage 
network structure. The model's structure was referred to as that of the YOLO 
network; meanwhile, several modules were added and adjusted in the backbone 
network. The one-stage backbone network received an attention module and a 
feature fusion module, and the Loss function was improved. When compared to 
various other mainstream object detection networks, our model outperforms them, 
with a mAP of 0.688. In addition, an iOS-based intelligent wheat head counting 
mobile app was created, which could calculate the number of wheat heads in 
images shot in an agricultural environment in less than a second.

Advancing diagnostic testing capabilities such as clinical next generation 
sequencing methods offer the potential to diagnose, risk stratify, and guide 
specialized treatment, but must be balanced against the escalating costs of 
healthcare to identify patient cases most likely to benefit from them. 
Heme-STAMP (Stanford Actionable Mutation Panel for Hematopoietic and Lymphoid 
Malignancies) is one such next generation sequencing test. Our objective is to 
assess how well Heme-STAMP pathological variants can be predicted given 
electronic health records data available at the time of test ordering. The model 
demonstrated AUROC 0.74 (95% CI: [0.72, 0.76]) with 99% negative predictive 
value at 6% specificity. A benchmark for comparison is the prevalence of 
positive results in the dataset at 58.7%. Identifying patients with very low or 
very high predicted probabilities of finding actionable mutations (positive 
result) could guide more precise high-value selection of patient cases to test.

OBJECTIVE: Digital microscopy is used to monitor particulates such as protein 
aggregates within biopharmaceutical products. The images that result encode a 
wealth of information that is underutilized in pharmaceutical process 
monitoring. For example, images of particles in protein drug products typically 
are analyzed only to obtain particle counts and size distributions, even though 
the images also reflect particle characteristics such as shape and refractive 
index. Multiple groups have demonstrated that convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs) can extract information from images of protein aggregates allowing 
assignment of the likely stress at the "root-cause" of aggregation. A practical 
limitation of previous CNN-based approaches is that the potential 
aggregation-inducing stresses must be known a priori, disallowing identification 
of particles produced by unknown stresses.
METHODS: We demonstrate an expanded CNN analysis of flow imaging microscopy 
(FIM) images incorporating judiciously chosen particle standards within a 
recently proposed "fingerprinting algorithm" (Biotechnol. & Bioeng. (2020) 
117:3322) that allows detection of particles formed by unknown root-causes. We 
focus on ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) microparticles as standard 
surrogates for protein aggregates. We quantify the sensitivity of the new 
algorithm to experimental parameters such as microscope focus and solution 
refractive index changes, and explore how FIM sample noise affects statistical 
testing procedures.
RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS: Applied to real-world microscopy images of protein 
aggregates, the algorithm reproducibly detects complex, distinguishing "textural 
features" of particles that are not easily described by standard morphological 
measurements. This offers promise for quality control applications and for 
detecting shifts in protein aggregate populations due to stresses resulting from 
unknown process upsets.

To understand mechanistically how the protein fold is shaped by therapeutics to 
inform precision management of disease, we developed variation-capture (VarC) 
mapping. VarC triangulates sparse sequence variation information found in the 
population using Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based machine learning to 
define the combined pairwise-residue interactions contributing to dynamic 
protein function in the individual in response to therapeutics. Using VarC 
mapping, we now reveal the pairwise-residue covariant relationships across the 
entire protein fold of cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR) to define the molecular mechanisms of clinically approved CF chemical 
modulators. We discover an energetically destabilized covariant core containing 
a di-acidic YKDAD endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit code that is only weakly 
corrected by current therapeutics. Our results illustrate that VarC provides a 
generalizable tool to triangulate information from genetic variation in the 
population to mechanistically discover therapeutic strategies that guide 
precision management of the individual.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease 
leading to substantial quality of life impairment with heterogeneous treatment 
responses. People with AD would benefit from personalised treatment strategies, 
whose design requires predicting how AD severity evolves for each individual.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a computational framework for personalised 
prediction of AD severity dynamics.
METHODS: We introduced EczemaPred, a computational framework to predict 
patient-dependent dynamic evolution of AD severity using Bayesian state-space 
models that describe latent dynamics of AD severity items and how they are 
measured. We used EczemaPred to predict the dynamic evolution of validated 
patient-oriented scoring atopic dermatitis (PO-SCORAD) by combining predictions 
from the models for the nine severity items of PO-SCORAD (six intensity signs, 
extent of eczema, and two subjective symptoms). We validated this approach using 
longitudinal data from two independent studies: a published clinical study in 
which PO-SCORAD was measured twice weekly for 347 AD patients over 17 weeks, and 
another one in which PO-SCORAD was recorded daily by 16 AD patients for 
12 weeks.
RESULTS: EczemaPred achieved good performance for personalised predictions of 
PO-SCORAD and its severity items daily to weekly. EczemaPred outperformed 
standard time-series forecasting models such as a mixed effect autoregressive 
model. The uncertainty in predicting PO-SCORAD was mainly attributed to that in 
predicting intensity signs (75% of the overall uncertainty).
CONCLUSIONS: EczemaPred serves as a computational framework to make a 
personalised prediction of AD severity dynamics relevant to clinical practice. 
EczemaPred is available as an R package.

Neuroimaging is among the most active research domains for the creation and 
management of open-access data repositories. Notably lacking from most data 
repositories are integrated capabilities for semantic representation. The 
Arkansas Imaging Enterprise System (ARIES) is a research data management system 
which features integrated capabilities to support semantic representations of 
multi-modal data from disparate sources (imaging, behavioral, or cognitive 
assessments), across common image-processing stages (preprocessing steps, 
segmentation schemes, analytic pipelines), as well as derived results 
(publishable findings). These unique capabilities ensure greater reproducibility 
of scientific findings across large-scale research projects. The current 
investigation was conducted with three collaborating teams who are using ARIES 
in a project focusing on neurodegeneration. Datasets included magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) data as well as non-imaging data obtained from a variety of 
assessments designed to measure neurocognitive functions (performance scores on 
neuropsychological tests). We integrate and manage these data with semantic 
representations based on axiomatically rich biomedical ontologies. These 
instantiate a knowledge graph that combines the data from the study cohorts into 
a shared semantic representation that explicitly accounts for relations among 
the entities that the data are about. This knowledge graph is stored in a 
triple-store database that supports reasoning over and querying these integrated 
data. Semantic integration of the non-imaging data using background information 
encoded in biomedical domain ontologies has served as a key feature-engineering 
step, allowing us to combine disparate data and apply analyses to explore 
associations, for instance, between hippocampal volumes and measures of 
cognitive functions derived from various assessment instruments.

Prescribing antidepressant medication is currently the most effective way of 
treating major depression, but only very few patients achieve permanent 
improvement. Therefore, it is important to identify objectively measurable 
markers for effective, personalized therapy. The aim of this review article is 
to collect all the markers that are robustly predictive of the outcome of 
therapy. We searched for systematic review articles that have simultaneously 
investigated the effects of as many different markers as possible on the 
response to antidepressant therapy in major depressive patients. From these we 
extracted markers that have been found to be significant by at least two 
independent review studies and that have proven replicable also within each of 
these reviews. A separate search was performed for meta-analyses of 
pharmacogenetic genome-wide association studies. Based on our results, onset 
time, symptom severity, presence of anhedonia, early treatment response, 
comorbid anxiety, alcohol consumption, frontal EEG theta activity, hippocampal 
volume, activity of anterior cingulate cortex, as well as a peripheral marker, 
serum BDNF levels have proven replicable predictors of antidepressant response. 
Pharmacogenomic studies to date have not yielded replicable results. Predictors 
identified as robust by our study may provide a starting point for future 
machine learning models within a 'big data' database of major depressive 
patients. (Neuropsychopharmacol Hung 2022; 24(1): 17-28).

OBJECTIVE: For real-time markerless tumour tracking in stereotactic lung 
radiotherapy, we propose a different approach which uses patient-specific deep 
learning (DL) using a personalised data generation strategy, avoiding the need 
for collection of a large patient data set. We validated our strategy with 
digital phantom simulation and epoxy phantom studies.
METHODS: We developed lung tumour tracking for radiotherapy using a 
convolutional neural network trained for each phantom's lesion by using multiple 
digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) generated from each phantom's 
treatment planning four-dimensional CT. We trained tumour-bone differentiation 
using large numbers of training DRRs generated with various projection 
geometries to simulate tumour motion. We solved the problem of using DRRs for 
training and X-ray images for tracking using the training DRRs with random 
contrast transformation and random noise addition.
RESULTS: We defined adequate tracking accuracy as the percentage frames 
satisfying <1 mm tracking error of the isocentre. In the simulation study, we 
achieved 100% tracking accuracy in 3 cm spherical and 1.5×2.25×3 cm ovoid 
masses. In the phantom study, we achieved 100 and 94.7% tracking accuracy in 3 
cm and 2 cm spherical masses, respectively. This required 32.5 ms/frame (30.8 
fps) real-time processing.
CONCLUSIONS: We proved the potential feasibility of a real-time markerless 
tumour tracking framework for stereotactic lung radiotherapy based on 
patient-specific DL with personalised data generation with digital phantom and 
epoxy phantom studies.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Using DL with personalised data generation is an 
efficient strategy for real-time lung tumour tracking.

The availability of multidimensional data together with the development of 
modern techniques for data analysis represent an exceptional opportunity for 
clinical pharmacology. Data science-defined in this special issue as the novel 
approaches to the collection, aggregation, and analysis of data-can 
significantly contribute to characterize drug-response variability at the 
individual level, thus enabling clinical pharmacology to become a critical 
contributor to personalized healthcare through precision dosing. We propose a 
minireview of methodologies for achieving precision dosing with a focus on an 
artificial intelligence technique called reinforcement learning, which is 
currently used for individualizing dosing regimen in patients with 
life-threatening diseases. We highlight the interplay of such techniques with 
conventional pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic approaches and discuss 
applicability in drug research and early development.

Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is one of the core elements of personalized medicine. PGx 
information reduces the likelihood of adverse drug reactions and optimizes 
therapeutic efficacy. St Catherine Specialty Hospital in Zagreb/Zabok, Croatia 
has implemented a personalized patient approach using the RightMed® 
Comprehensive PGx panel of 25 pharmacogenes plus Facor V Leiden, Factor II and 
MTHFR genes, which is interpreted by a special counseling team to offer the best 
quality of care. With the advent of significant technological advances comes 
another challenge: how can we harness the data to inform clinically actionable 
measures and how can we use it to develop better predictive risk models? We 
propose to apply the principles artificial intelligence to develop a medication 
optimization platform to prevent, manage and treat different diseases.

Musculoskeletal malignancies consist of a heterogenous group of mesenchymal 
tumors, often with high inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity. The early and 
accurate diagnosis of these malignancies can have a substantial impact on 
optimal treatment and quality of life for these patients. Several new 
applications and techniques have emerged in molecular imaging, including 
advances in multimodality imaging, the development of novel radiotracers, and 
advances in image analysis with radiomics and artificial intelligence. This 
review highlights the recent advances in molecular imaging modalities and the 
role of non-invasive imaging in evaluating tumor biology in the era of precision 
medicine.

BACKGROUND: Loneliness has drawn increasing attention over the past few decades 
due to rising recognition of its close connection with serious health issues, 
like dementia. Yet, researchers are failing to find solutions to alleviate the 
globally experienced burden of loneliness.
PURPOSE: This review aims to shed light on possible reasons for why 
interventions have been ineffective. We suggest new directions for research on 
loneliness as it relates to precision health, emerging technologies, digital 
phenotyping, and machine learning.
RESULTS: Current loneliness interventions are unsuccessful due to (i) their 
inconsideration of loneliness as a heterogeneous construct and (ii) not being 
targeted at individuals' needs and contexts. We propose a model for how 
loneliness interventions can move towards finding the right solution for the 
right person at the right time. Taking a precision health approach, we explore 
how transdisciplinary research can contribute to creating a more holistic 
picture of loneliness and shift interventions from treatment to prevention.
CONCLUSIONS: We urge the field to rethink metrics to account for diverse 
intra-individual experiences and trajectories of loneliness. Big data sharing 
and evolving technologies that emphasize human connection raise hope for 
realizing our model of precision health applied to loneliness. There is an 
urgent need for precise, integrated, and theory-driven interventions that focus 
on individuals' needs and the subjective burden of loneliness in the ageing 
context.

The recent accumulation of cancer genomic data provides an opportunity to 
understand how a tumor's genomic characteristics can affect its responses to 
drugs. This field, called pharmacogenomics, is a key area in the development of 
precision oncology. Deep learning (DL) methodology has emerged as a powerful 
technique to characterize and learn from rapidly accumulating pharmacogenomics 
data. We introduce the fundamentals and typical model architectures of DL. We 
review the use of DL in classification of cancers and cancer subtypes (diagnosis 
and treatment stratification of patients), prediction of drug response and drug 
synergy for individual tumors (treatment prioritization for a patient), drug 
repositioning and discovery and the study of mechanism/mode of action of 
treatments. For each topic, we summarize current genomics and pharmacogenomics 
data resources such as pan-cancer genomics data for cancer cell lines (CCLs) and 
tumors, and systematic pharmacologic screens of CCLs. By revisiting the 
published literature, including our in-house analyses, we demonstrate the 
unprecedented capability of DL enabled by rapid accumulation of data resources 
to decipher complex drug response patterns, thus potentially improving cancer 
medicine. Overall, this review provides an in-depth summary of state-of-the-art 
DL methods and up-to-date pharmacogenomics resources and future opportunities 
and challenges to realize the goal of precision oncology.

BACKGROUND: Human corneal grafts from organ culture need to have more than 2000 
endothelial cells/mm2 to be suitable for transplantation. Measurement of the 
endothelial cell density is complicated by invisible cell borders in phase 
contrast microscopy, as well as by limited areas for counting due to folds in 
the Descemet membrane of the swollen corneal grafts. To date, no automated 
counting method for measuring the endothelial cell density exists. The neuronal 
network U-Net has already proven itself in automated segmentation of specular 
microscopy images of human corneal endothelium. The aim of this study was the 
application of the U-Net in the quality control of human corneal grafts.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Training of the U-Net was performed using 100 manually 
tagged endothelial cell images of corneal grafts from the Lions eye bank in 
Baden-Württemberg. Another 100 images were obtained for testing the precision of 
measurements of the U-Net. These were adjudged manually by a) an experienced 
investigator and b) a less experienced ophthalmologist. The endothelial cells in 
identical images were then counted automatically by the trained U-Net. 
Comparison with the manually counted results was drawn by Pearson correlation.
RESULTS: The correlation coefficient between the U-Net and the experienced 
investigator as gold standard was 0.9. The correlation coefficient between the 
less experienced ophthalmologist and the gold standard was only 0.81. Both 
correlations were statistically highly significant (p < 0.0001).
DISCUSSION: The strong correlation between the U-Net and the gold standard 
points out that, given medical approval, effective assistance for eye banks is 
possible in quality control by automated counting. This could improve 
objectivity and efficiency of work flow.

Publisher: HINTERGRUND: Ein Hornhauttransplantat aus Organkultur darf i. d. R. 
nur verwendet werden, wenn präoperativ eine Endothelzelldichte von mindestens 
2000 Zellen pro mm2 nachgewiesen ist. Die Messung der Endothelzelldichte ist 
dadurch erschwert, dass in der Phasenkontrastmikroskopie die Zellgrenzen der 
Endothelzellen nicht immer gut sichtbar sind und die zählbare Fläche durch 
quellungsbedingte Descemet-Falten limitiert ist. Bislang ist daher keine 
automatische Methode zur Endothelzelldichtebestimmung in Hornhauttransplantaten 
verfügbar. Das neuronale Netzwerk U-Net hat sich in der vollautomatischen 
Analyse von spiegelmikroskopischen Aufnahmen des Hornhautendothels bewährt. Ziel 
dieser Studie war die Anwendung des U-Net in der Qualitätssicherung von 
Hornhauttransplantaten.
MATERIAL UND METHODEN: Das U-Net wurde zunächst anhand von 100 manuell 
markierten Befundungsbildern von Hornhäuten aus der Lions-Hornhautbank 
Baden-Württemberg trainiert. Für die Prüfung der Messgenauigkeit des U-Net 
wurden 100 weitere Befundungsbilder von der o. g. Hornhautbank zur Verfügung 
gestellt. Diese wurden jeweils von a) einer erfahrenen Befunderin und b) einem 
weniger erfahrenen Augenarzt manuell gezählt. Die identischen Bilder wurden 
vollautomatisch über das trainierte U-Net ausgezählt und dieses Ergebnis mit 
beiden manuellen Analysen mittels Pearson-Korrelation verglichen.
ERGEBNISSE: Der Korrelationskoeffizient zwischen dem U-Net und der erfahren 
Untersucherin als „Goldstandard“ betrug 0,90. Der Korrelationskoeffizient des 
weniger erfahrenen Augenarztes mit dem Goldstandard betrug nur 0,81. Beide 
Korrelationen erwiesen sich als statistisch hochsignifikant (p < 0,0001).
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Die enge Korrelation des U-Net mit dem „Goldstandard“ deutet 
darauf hin, dass mit dem U-Net, die medizintechnische Zulassung vorausgesetzt, 
eine effektive Unterstützung in der Qualitätsbeurteilung von 
Hornhauttransplantaten in der Hornhautbank möglich ist. Dies hätte Vorteile für 
die Objektivität und die Arbeitseffizienz.

This tutorial introduces recent developments in precision medicine for 
estimating treatment decision rules. The objective of these developments is to 
advance personalised healthcare by identifying an optimal treatment option for 
each individual patient based on each patient's characteristics. The methods 
detailed in this tutorial define composite variables from the patient measures 
that can be viewed as 'biosignatures' for differential treatment response, which 
we have termed 'generated effect modifiers'. In contrast to most machine 
learning approaches to precision medicine, these biosignatures are derived from 
linear and non-linear regression models and thus have the advantage of easy 
visualisation and ready interpretation. The methods are illustrated using 
examples from randomised clinical trials.

Tumor subclass detection and diagnosis is inevitable requirement for 
personalized medical treatment and refinement of the effects that the somatic 
cells show towards other clinical conditions. The genome of these somatic cells 
exhibits mutations and genetic variations of the breast cancer cells and helps 
in understanding the characteristic behavior of the cancer cells. But their 
analysis is limited to clustering and there is requirement to analyze what else 
can be done with the data for identifying the tumor subcategory and the stages 
of subclasses. In this work, we have extended the work with similar data 
(consisting of 105 breast tumor cell lines) to solve other detection and 
characterization problems through computation and intelligent representation 
learning. Most of our work comprises of systematic data cleaning, analysis, and 
building prediction models with deep computational architectures and establish 
that the transformed data can help in better distinction of the respective 
categories. Our main contribution is the novel gene-subcategory 
interaction-based regularization (GSIAR) based data selection and analysis 
concept, alongside the prediction, proven to enhance the performance of the 
classification techniques. Graphical Abstract A graphical abstract of our model 
- Gene-subcategory interaction affinity-based regularization (GSIAR).

Immunotherapies that employ immune checkpoint modulators (ICMs) have emerged as 
an effective treatment for a variety of solid cancers, as well as a paradigm 
shift in the treatment of cancers. Despite this breakthrough, the median 
survival time of glioblastoma patients has remained at about 2 years. Therefore, 
the safety and anti-cancer efficacy of combination therapies that include ICMs 
are being actively investigated. Because of the distinct mechanisms of ICMs, 
which restore the immune system's anti-tumor capacity, unconventional 
immune-related phenomena are increasingly being reported in terms of tumor 
response and progression, as well as adverse events. Indeed, immunotherapy 
response assessments for neuro-oncology (iRANO) play a central role in guiding 
cancer patient management and define a "wait and see strategy" for patients 
treated with ICMs in monotherapy with progressive disease on MRI. This article 
deciphers emerging research trends to ameliorate four challenges unaddressed by 
the iRANO criteria: (1) patient selection, (2) identification of immune-related 
phenomena other than pseudoprogression (i.e., hyperprogression, the abscopal 
effect, immune-related adverse events), (3) response assessment in combination 
therapies including ICM, and (4) alternatives to MRI. To this end, our article 
provides a structured approach for standardized selection and reporting of 
imaging modalities to enable the use of precision medicine by deciphering the 
characteristics of the tumor and its immune environment. Emerging preclinical or 
clinical innovations are also discussed as future directions such as 
immune-specific targeting and implementation of artificial intelligence 
algorithms.

In the last 2 decades, several neuroimaging studies investigated brain 
abnormalities associated with the early stages of psychosis in the hope that 
these could aid the prediction of onset and clinical outcome. Despite 
advancements in the field, neuroimaging has yet to deliver. This is in part 
explained by the use of univariate analytical techniques, small samples and lack 
of statistical power, lack of external validation of potential biomarkers, and 
lack of integration of nonimaging measures (eg, genetic, clinical, cognitive 
data). PSYSCAN is an international, longitudinal, multicenter study on the early 
stages of psychosis which uses machine learning techniques to analyze imaging, 
clinical, cognitive, and biological data with the aim of facilitating the 
prediction of psychosis onset and outcome. In this article, we provide an 
overview of the PSYSCAN protocol and we discuss benefits and methodological 
challenges of large multicenter studies that employ neuroimaging measures.

Tasking machine learning to predict segments of a time series requires 
estimating the parameters of a ML model with input/output pairs from the time 
series. We borrow two techniques used in statistical data assimilation in order 
to accomplish this task: time-delay embedding to prepare our input data and 
precision annealing as a training method. The precision annealing approach 
identifies the global minimum of the action ( - log[P]). In this way, we are 
able to identify the number of training pairs required to produce good 
generalizations (predictions) for the time series. We proceed from a scalar time 
series s(tn); tn = t0 + nΔt and, using methods of nonlinear time series 
analysis, show how to produce a DE > 1-dimensional time-delay embedding space in 
which the time series has no false neighbors as does the observed s(tn) time 
series. In that DE-dimensional space, we explore the use of feedforward 
multilayer perceptrons as network models operating on DE-dimensional input and 
producing DE-dimensional outputs.

IMPORTANCE: Various types of epilepsy are a leading cause of neurological 
disability worldwide; they have in common a propensity to recurrent unprovoked 
seizures. There is increasing interest in the concept of precision medicine for 
therapy. While treatment aimed at the level of an ion channel or single pathway 
has provided benefits for a small number of individuals with genetically 
mediated cases, a high-definition approach extending beyond genes to a broader 
array of personalized factors may improve outcomes.
OBSERVATIONS: Advances in sequencing technologies have driven genetic discovery 
in epilepsy. This has provided targets for precision medicine in monogenic types 
of epilepsy. However, these typically represent a small subset of all types of 
epilepsy, and to date, precision medicine in epilepsy has primarily focused on 
seizure reduction. Such a unifocal view may overlook neurodevelopmental and 
neuropsychiatric comorbidities, which can be more challenging than the seizures 
themselves. Therefore, a panoramic approach to treatment encompassing both 
molecular diagnostic techniques and amelioration of network function by 
addressing factors beyond seizure reduction may be considered as part of a 
high-definition approach to tackling epilepsy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: High-definition medicine will require the development 
of analytical techniques, including artificial intelligence, that use and 
combine behavioral, environmental, molecular genomic, chronotype, and 
microbiomic data to offer the best individualized therapeutic options for 
disease management in each person with epilepsy. While an accurate molecular 
diagnosis remains the first step of the iterative process to the development of 
a precision medicine for an epilepsy, treatment targeted at a single molecular 
pathway may reduce seizure frequency but are not likely to address the multiple 
comorbidities associated with involved aberrant neural networks. To provide an 
improvement in precision medicine for epilepsy, a high-definition approach may 
be required that encompasses a panoramic view of factors that can be manipulated 
either directly or indirectly, now and in the future.

Real-time and long-term behavioural monitoring systems in precision livestock 
farming have huge potential to improve welfare and productivity for the better 
health of farm animals. However, some of the biggest challenges for long-term 
monitoring systems relate to "concept drift", which occurs when systems are 
presented with challenging new or changing conditions, and/or in scenarios where 
training data is not accurately reflective of live sensed data. This study 
presents a combined offline algorithm and online learning algorithm which deals 
with concept drift and is deemed by the authors as a useful mechanism for 
long-term in-the-field monitoring systems. The proposed algorithm classifies 
three relevant sheep behaviours using information from an embedded edge device 
that includes tri-axial accelerometer and tri-axial gyroscope sensors. The 
proposed approach is for the first time reported in precision livestock behavior 
monitoring and demonstrates improvement in classifying relevant behaviour in 
sheep, in real-time, under dynamically changing conditions.

BACKGROUND: In recent months, multiple publications have demonstrated the use of 
convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify images of skin cancer as 
precisely as dermatologists. However, these CNNs failed to outperform the 
International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2016 challenge which ranked 
the average precision for classification of dermoscopic melanoma images. 
Accordingly, the technical progress represented by these studies is limited. In 
addition, the available reports are impossible to reproduce, due to incomplete 
descriptions of training procedures and the use of proprietary image databases 
or non-disclosure of used images. These factors prevent the comparison of 
various CNN classifiers in equal terms.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the training of an image-classifier CNN that 
outperforms the winner of the ISBI 2016 CNNs challenge by using open source 
images exclusively.
METHODS: A detailed description of the training procedure is reported while the 
used images and test sets are disclosed fully, to insure the reproducibility of 
our work.
RESULTS: Our CNN classifier outperforms all recent attempts to classify the 
original ISBI 2016 challenge test data (full set of 379 test images), with an 
average precision of 0.709 (vs. 0.637 of the ISBI winner) and with an area under 
the receiver operating curve of 0.85.
CONCLUSION: This work illustrates the potential for improving skin cancer 
classification with enhanced training procedures for CNNs, while avoiding the 
use of costly equipment or proprietary image data.

Precision medicine seeks to maximize the quality of healthcare by 
individualizing the healthcare process to the uniquely evolving health status of 
each patient. This endeavor spans a broad range of scientific areas including 
drug discovery, genetics/genomics, health communication, and causal inference 
all in support of evidence-based, i.e., data-driven, decision making. Precision 
medicine is formalized as a treatment regime which comprises a sequence of 
decision rules, one per decision point, which map up-to-date patient information 
to a recommended action. The potential actions could be the selection of which 
drug to use, the selection of dose, timing of administration, specific diet or 
exercise recommendation, or other aspects of treatment or care. Statistics 
research in precision medicine is broadly focused on methodological development 
for estimation of and inference for treatment regimes which maximize some 
cumulative clinical outcome. In this review, we provide an overview of this 
vibrant area of research and present important and emerging challenges.

The burgeoning research and applications of technological advances are launching 
the development of precision livestock farming. Through sensors (cameras, 
microphones and accelerometers), images, sounds and movements are combined with 
algorithms to non-invasively monitor animals to detect their welfare and predict 
productivity. In turn, this remote monitoring of livestock can provide 
quantitative and early alerts to situations of poor welfare requiring the 
stockperson's attention. While swine practitioners' skills include translation 
of pig data entry into pig health and well-being indices, many do not yet have 
enough familiarity to advise their clients on the adoption of precision 
livestock farming practices. This review, intended for swine veterinarians and 
specialists, (1) includes an introduction to algorithms and machine learning, 
(2) summarizes current literature on relevant sensors and sensor network 
systems, and drawing from industry pig welfare audit criteria, (3) explains how 
these applications can be used to improve swine welfare and meet current pork 
production stakeholder expectations. Swine practitioners, by virtue of their 
animal and client advocacy roles, interpretation of benchmarking data, and 
stewardship in regulatory and traceability programs, can play a broader role as 
advisors in the transfer of precision livestock farming technology, and its 
implications to their clients.

Precision medicine for the discovery of treatable mechanisms in severe asthma.

Harefield NHS Trust, London, UK.

Although the complex disease of asthma has been defined as being heterogeneous, 
the extent of its endophenotypes remains unclear. The pharmacological approach 
to initiating treatment has, until recently, been based on disease control and 
severity. The introduction of antibody therapies targeting the Type 2 
inflammation pathway for patients with severe asthma has resulted in the 
recognition of an allergic and an eosinophilic phenotype, which are not mutually 
exclusive. Concomitantly, molecular phenotyping based on a transcriptomic 
analysis of bronchial epithelial and sputum cells has identified a Type 2 high 
inflammation cluster characterized by eosinophilia and recurrent exacerbations, 
as well as Type 2 low clusters linked with IL-6 trans-signalling, interferon 
pathways, inflammasome activation and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation 
pathways. Systems biology approaches are establishing the links between these 
pathways or mechanisms, and clinical and physiologic features. Validation of 
these pathways contributes to defining endotypes and treatable mechanisms. 
Precision medicine approaches are necessary to link treatable mechanisms with 
treatable traits and biomarkers derived from clinical, physiologic and 
inflammatory features of clinical phenotypes. The deep molecular phenotyping of 
airway samples along with noninvasive biomarkers linked to bioinformatic and 
machine learning techniques will enable the rapid detection of molecular 
mechanisms that transgresses beyond the concept of treatable traits.

In this position review, we propose to establish a path for replacing the 
empirical classification of tinnitus with a taxonomy from precision medicine. 
The goal of a classification system is to understand the inherent heterogeneity 
of individuals experiencing and suffering from tinnitus and to identify what 
differentiates potential subgroups. Identification of different patient 
subgroups with distinct audiological, psychophysical, and neurophysiological 
characteristics will facilitate the management of patients with tinnitus as well 
as the design and execution of drug development and clinical trials, which, for 
the most part, have not yielded conclusive results. An alternative outcome of a 
precision medicine approach in tinnitus would be that additional mechanistic 
phenotyping might not lead to the identification of distinct drivers in each 
individual, but instead, it might reveal that each individual may display a 
quantitative blend of causal factors. Therefore, a precision medicine approach 
towards identifying these causal factors might not lead to subtyping these 
patients but may instead highlight causal pathways that can be manipulated for 
therapeutic gain. These two outcomes are not mutually exclusive, and no matter 
what the final outcome is, a mechanistic-driven precision medicine approach is a 
win-win approach for advancing tinnitus research and treatment. Although there 
are several controversies and inconsistencies in the tinnitus field, which will 
not be discussed here, we will give a few examples, as to how the field can move 
forward by exploring the major neurophysiological tinnitus models, mostly by 
taking advantage of the common features supported by all of the models. Our 
position stems from the central concept that, as a field, we can and must do 
more to bring studies of mechanisms into the realm of neuroscience.

Radiogenomics for Precision Medicine With a Big Data Analytics Perspective.

Panayides AS, Pattichis MS, Leandrou S, Pitris C, Constantinidou A, Pattichis 
CS.

Precision medicine promises better healthcare delivery by improving clinical 
practice. Using evidence-based substratification of patients, the objective is 
to achieve better prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment that will transform 
existing clinical pathways toward optimizing care for the specific needs of each 
patient. The wealth of today's healthcare data, often characterized as big data, 
provides invaluable resources toward new knowledge discovery that has the 
potential to advance precision medicine. The latter requires interdisciplinary 
efforts that will capitalize the information, know-how, and medical data of 
newly formed groups fusing different backgrounds and expertise. The objective of 
this paper is to provide insights with respect to the state-of-the-art research 
in precision medicine. More specifically, our goal is to highlight the 
fundamental challenges in emerging fields of radiomics and radiogenomics by 
reviewing the case studies of Cancer and Alzheimer's disease, describe the 
computational challenges from a big data analytics perspective, and discuss 
standardization and open data initiatives that will facilitate the adoption of 
precision medicine methods and practices.

Precision nutrition: hype or hope for public health interventions to reduce 
obesity?

High-income countries are experiencing an obesity epidemic that follows a 
socioeconomic gradient, affecting groups of lower socioeconomic status 
disproportionately. Recent clinical findings have suggested new perspectives for 
the prevention and treatment of obesity, using personalized dietary approaches. 
Precision nutrition (PN), also called personalized nutrition, has been developed 
to deliver more preventive and practical dietary advice than 'one-size-fits-all' 
guidelines. With interventions becoming increasingly plausible at a large scale 
thanks to artificial intelligence and smartphone applications, some have begun 
to view PN as a novel way to deliver the right dietary intervention to the right 
population. We argue that large-scale PN, if taken alone, might be of limited 
interest from a public health perspective. Building on Geoffrey Rose's theory 
regarding the differences in individual and population causes of disease, we 
show that large-scale PN can only address some individual causes of obesity 
(causes of cases). This individual-centred approach is likely to have a small 
impact on the distribution of obesity at a population level because it ignores 
the population causes of obesity (causes of incidence). The latter are embedded 
in the populations' social, cultural, economic and political contexts that make 
environments obesogenic. Additionally, the most socially privileged groups in 
the population are the most likely to respond to large-scale PN interventions. 
This could have the undesirable effect of widening social inequalities in 
obesity. We caution public health actors that interventions based only on 
large-scale PN are unlikely, despite current expectations, to improve dietary 
intake or reduce obesity at a population level.

OBJECTIVE: Precision medicine allows healthcare interventions to be tailored to 
groups of patients based on their disease susceptibility, diagnostic or 
prognostic information, or treatment response. We analysed what developments are 
expected in precision medicine over the next decade and considered the 
implications for health technology assessment (HTA) agencies.
METHODS: We performed a pragmatic literature search to account for the large 
size and wide scope of the precision medicine literature. We refined and 
enriched these results with a series of expert interviews up to 1 h in length, 
including representatives from HTA agencies, research councils and researchers 
designed to cover a wide spectrum of precision medicine applications and 
research.
RESULTS: We identified 31 relevant papers and interviewed 13 experts. We found 
that three types of precision medicine are expected to emerge in clinical 
practice: complex algorithms, digital health applications and 'omics'-based 
tests. These are expected to impact upon each stage of the HTA process, from 
scoping and modelling through to decision-making and review. The complex and 
uncertain treatment pathways associated with patient stratification and 
fast-paced technological innovation are central to these effects.
DISCUSSION: Innovation in precision medicine promises substantial benefits but 
will change the way in which some health services are delivered and evaluated. 
The shelf life of guidance may decrease, structural uncertainty may increase and 
new equity considerations will emerge. As biomarker discovery accelerates and 
artificial intelligence-based technologies emerge, refinements to the methods 
and processes of evidence assessments will help to adapt and maintain the 
objective of investing in healthcare that is value for money.

Network-based analytics plays an increasingly important role in precision 
oncology. Growing evidence in recent studies suggests that cancer can be better 
understood through mutated or dysregulated pathways or networks rather than 
individual mutations and that the efficacy of repositioned drugs can be inferred 
from disease modules in molecular networks. This article reviews network-based 
machine learning and graph theory algorithms for integrative analysis of 
personal genomic data and biomedical knowledge bases to identify tumor-specific 
molecular mechanisms, candidate targets and repositioned drugs for personalized 
treatment. The review focuses on the algorithmic design and mathematical 
formulation of these methods to facilitate applications and implementations of 
network-based analysis in the practice of precision oncology. We review the 
methods applied in three scenarios to integrate genomic data and network models 
in different analysis pipelines, and we examine three categories of 
network-based approaches for repositioning drugs in drug-disease-gene networks. 
In addition, we perform a comprehensive subnetwork/pathway analysis of mutations 
in 31 cancer genome projects in the Cancer Genome Atlas and present a detailed 
case study on ovarian cancer. Finally, we discuss interesting observations, 
potential pitfalls and future directions in network-based precision oncology.

Clinical research and practice in the 21st century is poised to be transformed 
by analysis of computable electronic medical records and population-level 
genome-scale patient profiles. Genomic data capture genetic and environmental 
state, providing information on heterogeneity in disease and treatment outcome, 
but genomic-based clinical risk scores are limited. Achieving the goal of 
routine precision medicine that takes advantage of these rich genomics data will 
require computational methods that support heterogeneous data, have excellent 
predictive performance, and ideally, provide biologically interpretable results. 
Traditional machine-learning approaches excel at performance, but often have 
limited interpretability. Patient similarity networks are an emerging paradigm 
for precision medicine, in which patients are clustered or classified based on 
their similarities in various features, including genomic profiles. This 
strategy is analogous to standard medical diagnosis, has excellent performance, 
is interpretable, and can preserve patient privacy. We review new methods based 
on patient similarity networks, including Similarity Network Fusion for patient 
clustering and netDx for patient classification. While these methods are already 
useful, much work is required to improve their scalability for contemporary 
genetic cohorts, optimize parameters, and incorporate a wide range of genomics 
and clinical data. The coming 5 years will provide an opportunity to assess the 
utility of network-based algorithms for precision medicine.

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the most popular numerical 
algorithms used in machine learning and other domains. Since this is likely to 
continue for the foreseeable future, it is important to study techniques that 
can make it run fast on parallel hardware. In this paper, we provide the first 
analysis of a technique called Buckwild! that uses both asynchronous execution 
and low-precision computation. We introduce the DMGC model, the first 
conceptualization of the parameter space that exists when implementing 
low-precision SGD, and show that it provides a way to both classify these 
algorithms and model their performance. We leverage this insight to propose and 
analyze techniques to improve the speed of low-precision SGD. First, we propose 
software optimizations that can increase throughput on existing CPUs by up to 
11×. Second, we propose architectural changes, including a new cache technique 
we call an obstinate cache, that increase throughput beyond the limits of 
current-generation hardware. We also implement and analyze low-precision SGD on 
the FPGA, which is a promising alternative to the CPU for future SGD systems.

Drug development continues to be costly and slow, with medications failing due 
to lack of efficacy or presence of toxicity. The promise of pharmacogenomic 
discovery includes tailoring therapeutics based on an individual's genetic 
makeup, rational drug development, and repurposing medications. Rapid growth of 
large research cohorts, linked to electronic health record (EHR) data, fuels 
discovery of new genetic variants predicting drug action, supports Mendelian 
randomization experiments to show drug efficacy, and suggests new indications 
for existing medications. New biomedical informatics and machine-learning 
approaches advance the ability to interpret clinical information, enabling 
identification of complex phenotypes and subpopulations of patients. We review 
the recent history of use of "big data" from EHR-based cohorts and biobanks 
supporting these activities. Future studies using EHR data, other information 
sources, and new methods will promote a foundation for discovery to more rapidly 
advance precision medicine.

SUMMARY: Precision oncology is an approach that accounts for individual 
differences to guide cancer management. Omics signatures have been shown to 
predict clinical traits for cancer patients. However, the vast amount of omics 
information poses an informatics challenge in systematically identifying 
patterns associated with health outcomes, and no general purpose data mining 
tool exists for physicians, medical researchers and citizen scientists without 
significant training in programming and bioinformatics. To bridge this gap, we 
built the Omics AnalySIs System for PRecision Oncology (OASISPRO), a web-based 
system to mine the quantitative omics information from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA). This system effectively visualizes patients' clinical profiles, executes 
machine-learning algorithms of choice on the omics data and evaluates the 
prediction performance using held-out test sets. With this tool, we successfully 
identified genes strongly associated with tumor stage, and accurately predicted 
patients' survival outcomes in many cancer types, including adrenocortical 
carcinoma. By identifying the links between omics and clinical phenotypes, this 
system will facilitate omics studies on precision cancer medicine and contribute 
to establishing personalized cancer treatment plans.

BACKGROUND: The biomarker profile of trauma patients may allow for the creation 
of models to assist bedside decision making and prediction of complications. We 
sought to determine the utility of modeling in the prediction of bacteremia and 
pneumonia in combat casualties.
METHODS: This is a prospective, observational trial of patients with complex 
wounds treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (2007-2012). 
Tissue, serum, and wound effluent samples were collected during operative 
interventions until wound closure. Clinical, biomarker, and outcome data were 
used in machine learning algorithms to develop models predicting bacteremia or 
pneumonia. Modeling was performed on the first operative washout to maximize 
predictive benefit. Variable selection of dataset variables was performed and 
the best-fitting Bayesian belief network (BBN), using Bayesian information 
criterion (BIC), was selected for predictive modeling. Random forest was 
performed using variables from BBN step. Model performance was evaluated using 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis.
RESULTS: Seventy-three patients (mean age 23, mean Injury Severity Score 25) 
were enrolled. Patients required a median of 3 (2-13) operations. The incidence 
of bacteremia and pneumonia was 22% and 12%, respectively. Best-fitting variable 
selected BBNs were maximum-minimum parents and children (MMPC) for both 
bacteremia (BIC-24948) and pneumonia (BIC-17886). Full variable and MMPC random 
forest models AUC were 0.721 and 0.834, respectively, for bacteremia and 0.809 
and 0.856, respectively, for pneumonia.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a profile predictive of bacteremia and pneumonia in 
combat casualties. This has important clinical implications and should be 
validated in the civilian trauma population. This and similar tools will allow 
for increasing precision in the management of critically ill and injured 
patients.

The goal of this study is to address two major issues that undermine the large 
scale deployment of smart home sensing solutions in people's homes. These 
include the costs associated with having to install and maintain a large number 
of sensors, and the pragmatics of annotating numerous sensor data streams for 
activity classification. Our aim was therefore to propose a method to describe 
individual users' behavioural patterns starting from unannotated data analysis 
of a minimal number of sensors and a "blind" approach for activity recognition. 
The methodology included processing and analysing sensor data from 17 older 
adults living in community-based housing to extract activity information at 
different times of the day. The findings illustrate that 55 days of sensor data 
from a sensor configuration comprising three sensors, and extracting appropriate 
features including a "busyness" measure, are adequate to build robust models 
which can be used for clustering individuals based on their behaviour patterns 
with a high degree of accuracy (>85%). The obtained clusters can be used to 
describe individual behaviour over different times of the day. This approach 
suggests a scalable solution to support optimising the personalisation of care 
by utilising low-cost sensing and analysis. This approach could be used to track 
a person's needs over time and fine-tune their care plan on an ongoing basis in 
a cost-effective manner.

Precision global health is an approach similar to precision medicine, which 
facilitates, through innovation and technology, better targeting of public 
health interventions on a global scale, for the purpose of maximising their 
effectiveness and relevance. Illustrative examples include: the use of remote 
sensing data to fight vector-borne diseases; large databases of genomic 
sequences of foodborne pathogens helping to identify origins of outbreaks; 
social networks and internet search engines for tracking communicable diseases; 
cell phone data in humanitarian actions; drones to deliver healthcare services 
in remote and secluded areas. Open science and data sharing platforms are 
proposed for fostering international research programmes under fair, ethical and 
respectful conditions. Innovative education, such as massive open online courses 
or serious games, can promote wider access to training in public health and 
improving health literacy. The world is moving towards learning healthcare 
systems. Professionals are equipped with data collection and decision support 
devices. They share information, which are complemented by external sources, and 
analysed in real time using machine learning techniques. They allow for the 
early detection of anomalies, and eventually guide appropriate public health 
interventions. This article shows how information-driven approaches, enabled by 
digital technologies, can help improving global health with greater equity.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous 
clinical syndrome that may benefit from improved subtyping in order to better 
characterize its pathophysiology and to develop novel targeted therapies. The 
United States Precision Medicine Initiative comes amid the rapid growth in 
quantity and modality of clinical data for HFpEF patients ranging from deep 
phenotypic to trans-omic data. Tensor factorization, a form of machine learning, 
allows for the integration of multiple data modalities to derive clinically 
relevant HFpEF subtypes that may have significant differences in underlying 
pathophysiology and differential response to therapies. Tensor factorization 
also allows for better interpretability by supporting dimensionality reduction 
and identifying latent groups of data for meaningful summarization of both 
features and disease outcomes. In this narrative review, we analyze the modest 
literature on the application of tensor factorization to related biomedical 
fields including genotyping and phenotyping. Based on the cited work including 
work of our own, we suggest multiple tensor factorization formulations capable 
of integrating the deep phenotypic and trans-omic modalities of data for HFpEF, 
or accounting for interactions between genetic variants at different omic 
hierarchies. We encourage extensive experimental studies to tackle challenges in 
applying tensor factorization for precision medicine in HFpEF, including 
effectively incorporating existing medical knowledge, properly accounting for 
uncertainty, and efficiently enforcing sparsity for better interpretability.

Systemic sclerosis is an orphan, systemic autoimmune disease with no 
FDA-approved treatments. Its heterogeneity and rarity often result in 
underpowered clinical trials making the analysis and interpretation of 
associated molecular data challenging. We performed a meta-analysis of gene 
expression data from skin biopsies of patients with systemic sclerosis treated 
with five therapies: mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, abatacept, nilotinib, and 
fresolimumab. A common clinical improvement criterion of -20% or -5 modified 
Rodnan skin score was applied to each study. We applied a machine learning 
approach that captured features beyond differential expression and was better at 
identifying targets of therapies than the differential expression alone. 
Regardless of treatment mechanism, abrogation of inflammatory pathways 
accompanied clinical improvement in multiple studies suggesting that high 
expression of immune-related genes indicates active and targetable disease. Our 
framework allowed us to compare different trials and ask if patients who failed 
one therapy would likely improve on a different therapy, based on changes in 
gene expression. Genes with high expression at baseline in fresolimumab 
nonimprovers were downregulated in mycophenolate mofetil improvers, suggesting 
that immunomodulatory or combination therapy may have benefitted these patients. 
This approach can be broadly applied to increase tissue specificity and 
sensitivity of differential expression results.

The field of personalized and precise medicine in the era of big data analytics 
is growing rapidly. Previously, we proposed our model of patient classification 
termed Prognostic Signature Vector Matching (PSVM) and identified a 37 variable 
signature comprising 36 let-7b associated prognostic significant mRNAs and the 
age risk factor that stratified large high-grade serous ovarian cancer patient 
cohorts into three survival-significant risk groups. Here, we investigated the 
predictive performance of PSVM via optimization of the prognostic variable 
weights, which represent the relative importance of one prognostic variable over 
the others. In addition, we compared several multivariate prognostic models 
based on PSVM with classical machine learning techniques such as 
K-nearest-neighbor, support vector machine, random forest, neural networks and 
logistic regression. Our results revealed that negative log-rank p-values 
provides more robust weight values as opposed to the use of other quantities 
such as hazard ratios, fold change, or a combination of those factors. PSVM, 
together with the classical machine learning classifiers were combined in an 
ensemble (multi-test) voting system, which collectively provides a more precise 
and reproducible patient stratification. The use of the multi-test system 
approach, rather than the search for the ideal classification/prediction method, 
might help to address limitations of the individual classification algorithm in 
specific situation.

The rise of technologies that simultaneously measure thousands of data points 
represents the heart of systems biology. These technologies have had a huge 
impact on the discovery of next-generation diagnostics, biomarkers, and drugs in 
the precision medicine era. Systems biology aims to achieve systemic exploration 
of complex interactions in biological systems. Driven by high-throughput omics 
technologies and the computational surge, it enables multi-scale and insightful 
overviews of cells, organisms, and populations. Precision medicine capitalizes 
on these conceptual and technological advancements and stands on two main 
pillars: data generation and data modeling. High-throughput omics technologies 
allow the retrieval of comprehensive and holistic biological information, 
whereas computational capabilities enable high-dimensional data modeling and, 
therefore, accessible and user-friendly visualization. Furthermore, 
bioinformatics has enabled comprehensive multi-omics and clinical data 
integration for insightful interpretation. Despite their promise, the 
translation of these technologies into clinically actionable tools has been 
slow. In this review, we present state-of-the-art multi-omics data analysis 
strategies in a clinical context. The challenges of omics-based biomarker 
translation are discussed. Perspectives regarding the use of multi-omics 
approaches for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are presented by introducing a 
new paradigm shift in addressing IEM investigations in the post-genomic era.

We develop an R package fastclime for solving a family of regularized linear 
programming (LP) problems. Our package efficiently implements the parametric 
simplex algorithm, which provides a scalable and sophisticated tool for solving 
large-scale linear programs. As an illustrative example, one use of our LP 
solver is to implement an important sparse precision matrix estimation method 
called CLIME (Constrained L1 Minimization Estimator). Compared with existing 
packages for this problem such as clime and flare, our package has three 
advantages: (1) it efficiently calculates the full piecewise-linear 
regularization path; (2) it provides an accurate dual certificate as stopping 
criterion; (3) it is completely coded in C and is highly portable. This package 
is designed to be useful to statisticians and machine learning researchers for 
solving a wide range of problems.

For the first time, prediction accuracies of some supervised and unsupervised 
algorithms were evaluated in an SSR-based DNA fingerprinting study of a pea 
collection containing 20 cultivars and 57 wild samples. In general, according to 
the 10 attribute weighting models, the SSR alleles of PEAPHTAP-2 and 
PSBLOX13.2-1 were the two most important attributes to generate discrimination 
among eight different species and subspecies of genus Pisum. In addition, 
K-Medoids unsupervised clustering run on Chi squared dataset exhibited the best 
prediction accuracy (83.12%), while the lowest accuracy (25.97%) gained as 
K-Means model ran on FCdb database. Irrespective of some fluctuations, the 
overall accuracies of tree induction models were significantly high for many 
algorithms, and the attributes PSBLOX13.2-3 and PEAPHTAP could successfully 
detach Pisum fulvum accessions and cultivars from the others when two selected 
decision trees were taken into account. Meanwhile, the other used supervised 
algorithms exhibited overall reliable accuracies, even though in some rare 
cases, they gave us low amounts of accuracies. Our results, altogether, 
demonstrate promising applications of both supervised and unsupervised 
algorithms to provide suitable data mining tools regarding accurate 
fingerprinting of different species and subspecies of genus Pisum, as a 
fundamental priority task in breeding programs of the crop.

BACKGROUND: Information obtained from diverse data sources can be combined in a 
principled manner using various machine learning methods to increase the 
reliability and range of knowledge about protein function. The result is a 
weighted functional linkage network (FLN) in which linked neighbors share at 
least one function with high probability. Precision is, however, low. Aiming to 
provide precise functional annotation for as many proteins as possible, we 
explore and propose a two-step framework for functional annotation (1) 
construction of a high-coverage and reliable FLN via machine learning techniques 
(2) development of a decision rule for the constructed FLN to optimize 
functional annotation.
RESULTS: We first apply this framework to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the first 
step, we demonstrate that four commonly used machine learning methods, Linear 
SVM, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naïve Bayes, and Neural Network, all combine 
heterogeneous data to produce reliable and high-coverage FLNs, in which the 
linkage weight more accurately estimates functional coupling of linked proteins 
than use individual data sources alone. In the second step, empirical tuning of 
an adjustable decision rule on the constructed FLN reveals that basing 
annotation on maximum edge weight results in the most precise annotation at high 
coverages. In particular at low coverage all rules evaluated perform comparably. 
At coverage above approximately 50%, however, they diverge rapidly. At full 
coverage, the maximum weight decision rule still has a precision of 
approximately 70%, whereas for other methods, precision ranges from a high of 
slightly more than 30%, down to 3%. In addition, a scoring scheme to estimate 
the precisions of individual predictions is also provided. Finally, tests of the 
robustness of the framework indicate that our framework can be successfully 
applied to less studied organisms.
CONCLUSION: We provide a general two-step function-annotation framework, and 
show that high coverage, high precision annotations can be achieved by 
constructing a high-coverage and reliable FLN via data integration followed by 
applying a maximum weight decision rule.

Personalised medicine (PM) presents a great opportunity to improve the future of 
individualised healthcare. Recent advances in -omics technologies have led to 
unprecedented efforts characterising the biology and molecular mechanisms that 
underlie the development and progression of a wide array of complex human 
diseases, supporting further development of PM. This article reflects the 
outcome of the 2021 EATRIS-Plus Multi-omics Stakeholder Group workshop organised 
to 1) outline a global overview of common promises and challenges that key 
European stakeholders are facing in the field of multi-omics research, 2) assess 
the potential of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), and 3) 
establish an initial dialogue between key initiatives in this space. Our focus 
is on the alignment of agendas of European initiatives in multi-omics research 
and the centrality of patients in designing solutions that have the potential to

The measurement of exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath 
(breathomics) represents an exciting biomarker matrix for airways disease, with 
early research indicating a sensitivity to airway inflammation. One of the key 
aspects to analytical validity for any clinical biomarker is an understanding of 
the short-term repeatability of measures. We collected exhaled breath samples on 
5 consecutive days in 14 subjects with severe asthma who had undergone extensive 
clinical characterisation. Principal component analysis on VOC abundance across 
all breath samples revealed no variance due to the day of sampling. Samples from 
the same patients clustered together and there was some separation according to 
T2 inflammatory markers. The intra-subject and between-subject variability of 
each VOC was calculated across the 70 samples and identified 30.35% of VOCs to 
be erratic: variable between subjects but also variable in the same subject. 
Exclusion of these erratic VOCs from machine learning approaches revealed no 
apparent loss of structure to the underlying data or loss of relationship with 
salient clinical characteristics. Moreover, cluster evaluation by the silhouette 
coefficient indicates more distinct clustering. We are able to describe the 
short-term repeatability of breath samples in a severe asthma population and 
corroborate its sensitivity to airway inflammation. We also describe a novel 
variance-based feature selection tool that, when applied to larger clinical 
studies, could improve machine learning model predictions.

The rapid finding of effective therapeutics requires efficient use of available 
resources in clinical trials. Covariate adjustment can yield statistical 
estimates with improved precision, resulting in a reduction in the number of 
participants required to draw futility or efficacy conclusions. We focus on 
time-to-event and ordinal outcomes. When more than a few baseline covariates are 
available, a key question for covariate adjustment in randomised studies is how 
to fit a model relating the outcome and the baseline covariates to maximise 
precision. We present a novel theoretical result establishing conditions for 
asymptotic normality of a variety of covariate-adjusted estimators that rely on 
machine learning (e.g., ℓ1 -regularisation, Random Forests, XGBoost, and 
Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines [MARS]), under the assumption that 
outcome data are missing completely at random. We further present a consistent 
estimator of the asymptotic variance. Importantly, the conditions do not require 
the machine learning methods to converge to the true outcome distribution 
conditional on baseline variables, as long as they converge to some (possibly 
incorrect) limit. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the performance of 
the aforementioned prediction methods in COVID-19 trials. Our simulation is 
based on resampling longitudinal data from over 1500 patients hospitalised with 
COVID-19 at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital. We found that 
using ℓ1 -regularisation led to estimators and corresponding hypothesis tests 
that control type 1 error and are more precise than an unadjusted estimator 
across all sample sizes tested. We also show that when covariates are not 
prognostic of the outcome, ℓ1 -regularisation remains as precise as the 
unadjusted estimator, even at small sample sizes ( n = 100 ). We give an R 
package adjrct that performs model-robust covariate adjustment for ordinal and 
time-to-event outcomes.

Functional precision medicine is a new, emerging area that can guide cancer 
treatment by capturing information from direct perturbations of tumor-derived, 
living cells, such as by drug sensitivity screening. Precision cancer medicine 
as currently implemented in clinical practice has been driven by genomics, and 
current molecular tumor boards rely extensively on genomic characterization to 
advise on therapeutic interventions. However, genomic biomarkers can only guide 
treatment decisions for a fraction of the patients. In this review we provide an 
overview of the current state of functional precision medicine, highlight 
advances for drug-sensitivity screening enabled by cell culture models, and 
discuss how artificial intelligence (AI) can be coupled to functional precision 
medicine to guide patient stratification.

Background: Mitophagy is closely related to cancer initiation and progression. 
However, heterogeneity with reference to mitophagy remains unexplored in 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). Materials and methods: We used Reactome 
database to download the mitophagy-related, glycolysis-related and cholesterol 
biosynthesis-related signaling pathways. Unsupervised clustering using the 
"ConsensusClusterPlus" R package was performed to identify molecular subtypes 
related to mitophagy and metabolism. Prognosis-related mitophagy regulators were 
identified by univariate Cox regression analysis. Receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analyses were used to 
assess the diagnostic and prognostic role of the hub genes and prognosis risk 
model. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was utilized for 
screening the mitophagy subtype-related hub genes. Metascape was utilized to 
carry out functional enrichment analysis. The "glmnet" R package was utilised 
for LASSO, and the "e1071" R package was utilised for SVM. Chemotherapeutic drug 
sensitivity was estimated using the R package "pRRophetic" and Genomics of Drug 
Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. The nomogram was established by the "rms" 
R package. Results: Three distinct mitophagy subtypes (low, high and 
intermediate) of PAAD were identified based on the landscape of mitophagy 
regulators. The high mitophagy subtype had the worst prognosis, highest mRNA 
expression-based stemness index scores and most hypoxic environment compared to 
the other subtypes. Additionally, glycolysis and cholesterol biosynthesis were 
significantly elevated. Three mitophagy subtype-specific gene signatures (CAST, 
CCDC6, and ERLIN1) were extracted using WGCNA and machine learning. Moreover, 
PAAD tumours were insensitive to Erlotinib, Sunitinib and Imatinib in the high 
mitophagy subtype and high CAST, CCDC6, and ERLIN1 expressed subtypes. 
Furthermore, CAST, CCDC6, and ERLIN1 affected immune cell infiltration (M1 and 
CD8Tcm), resulting in the altered prognosis of patients with PAAD. A nomogram 
was constructed to screen patients with the low mitophagy subtype, which showed 
a higher sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Conclusion: Based on various 
bioinformatics tools and databases, the PAAD heterogeneity regarding mitophagy 
was systematically examined. Three different PAAD subtypes having different 
outcomes, metabolism patterns and chemosensitivity were observed. Moreover, 
three novel biomarkers that are closely associated with mitophagy and have the 
potential to guide individualised treatment regimens in PAAD were obtained.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a significant planetary health burden. CLD 
includes a broad range of liver pathologies from different causes, for example, 
hepatitis B virus infection, fatty liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or the metabolic associated fatty liver 
disease. Biomarker and diagnostic discovery, and new molecular targets for 
precision treatments are timely and sorely needed in CLD. In this context, 
multi-omics data integration is increasingly being facilitated by artificial 
intelligence (AI) and attendant digital transformation of systems science. While 
the digital transformation of multi-omics integrative analyses is still in its 
infancy, there are noteworthy prospects, hope, and challenges for diagnostic and 
therapeutic innovation in CLD. This expert review aims at the emerging knowledge 
frontiers as well as gaps in multi-omics data integration at bulk tissue levels, 
and those including single cell-level data, gut microbiome data, and finally, 
those incorporating tissue-specific information. We refer to AI and related 
digital transformation of the CLD research and development field whenever 
possible. This review of the emerging frontiers at the intersection of systems 
science and digital transformation informs future roadmaps to bridge digital 
technology discovery and clinical omics applications to benefit planetary health 
and patients with CLD.

Precision medicine has greatly aided in improving health outcomes using earlier 
diagnosis and better prognosis for chronic diseases. It makes use of clinical 
data associated with the patient as well as their multi-omics/genomic data to 
reach a conclusion regarding how a physician should proceed with a specific 
treatment. Compared to the symptom-driven approach in medicine, precision 
medicine considers the critical fact that all patients do not react to the same 
treatment or medication in the same way. When considering the intersection of 
traditionally distinct arenas of medicine, that is, artificial intelligence, 
healthcare, clinical genomics, and pharmacogenomics-what ties them together is 
their impact on the development of precision medicine as a field and how they 
each contribute to patient-specific, rather than symptom-specific patient 
outcomes. This study discusses the impact and integration of these different 
fields in the scope of precision medicine and how they can be used in preventing 
and predicting acute or chronic diseases. Additionally, this study also 
discusses the advantages as well as the current challenges associated with 
artificial intelligence, healthcare, clinical genomics, and pharmacogenomics.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc), a complex multi-systemic disease characterized by 
immune dysregulation, vasculopathy and fibrosis, is associated with high 
mortality. Its pathogenesis is only partially understood. The heterogenous 
pathological processes that define SSc and its stages present a challenge to 
targeting appropriate treatment, with differing treatment outcomes of SSc 
patients despite similar initial clinical presentations. Timing of the 
appropriate treatments targeted at the underlying disease process is critical. 
For example, immunomodulatory treatments may be used for patients in a 
predominantly inflammatory phase, anti-fibrotic treatments for those in the 
fibrotic phase, or combination therapies for those in the fibro-inflammatory 
phase. In advancing personalized care through precision medicine, groups of 
patients with similar disease characteristics and shared pathological processes 
may be identified through molecular stratification. This would improve current 
clinical sub-setting systems and guide personalization of therapies. In this 
review, we will provide updates in SSc clinical and molecular stratification in 
relation to patient outcomes and treatment responses. Promises of molecular 
stratification through advances in high-dimensional tools, including omic-based 
stratification (transcriptomics, genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, cytomics, 
microbiomics) and machine learning will be discussed. Innovative and more 
granular stratification systems that integrate molecular characteristics to 
clinical phenotypes would potentially improve therapeutic approaches through 
personalized medicine and lead to better patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to precisely phenotype culprit and 
nonculprit lesions in myocardial infarction (MI) and lesions in stable coronary 
artery disease (CAD) using coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA)-based 
radiomic analysis.
BACKGROUND: It remains debated whether any single coronary atherosclerotic 
plaque within the vulnerable patient exhibits unique morphology conferring an 
increased risk of clinical events.
METHODS: A total of 60 patients with acute MI prospectively underwent coronary 
CTA before invasive angiography and were matched to 60 patients with stable CAD. 
For all coronary lesions, high-risk plaque (HRP) characteristics were 
qualitatively assessed, followed by semiautomated plaque quantification and 
extraction of 1,103 radiomic features. Machine learning models were built to 
examine the additive value of radiomic features for discriminating culprit 
lesions over and above HRP and plaque volumes.
RESULTS: Culprit lesions had higher mean volumes of noncalcified plaque (NCP) 
and low-density noncalcified plaque (LDNCP) compared with the highest-grade 
stenosis nonculprits and highest-grade stenosis stable CAD lesions (NCP: 
138.1 mm3 vs 110.7 mm3 vs 102.7 mm3; LDNCP: 14.2 mm3 vs 9.8 mm3 vs 8.4 mm3; both 
Ptrend < 0.01). In multivariable linear regression adjusted for NCP and LDNCP 
volumes, 14.9% (164 of 1,103) of radiomic features were associated with culprits 
and 9.7% (107 of 1,103) were associated with the highest-grade stenosis 
nonculprits (critical P < 0.0007) when compared with highest-grade stenosis 
stable CAD lesions as reference. Hierarchical clustering of significant radiomic 
features identified 9 unique data clusters (latent phenotypes): 5 contained 
radiomic features specific to culprits, 1 contained features specific to 
highest-grade stenosis nonculprits, and 3 contained features associated with 
either lesion type. Radiomic features provided incremental value for 
discriminating culprit lesions when added to a machine learning model containing 
HRP and plaque volumes (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 
0.86 vs 0.76; P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Culprit lesions and highest-grade stenosis nonculprit lesions in MI 
have distinct radiomic signatures compared with lesions in stable CAD. Within 
the vulnerable patient may exist individual vulnerable plaques identifiable by 
coronary CTA-based precision phenotyping.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: A multi-institutional interdisciplinary team was created to 
develop a research group focused on leveraging artificial intelligence and 
informatics for cardio-oncology patients. Cardio-oncology is an emerging medical 
field dedicated to prevention, screening, and management of adverse 
cardiovascular effects of cancer/ cancer therapies. Cardiovascular disease is a 
leading cause of death in cancer survivors. Cardiovascular risk in these 
patients is higher than in the general population. However, prediction and 
prevention of adverse cardiovascular events in individuals with a history of 
cancer/cancer treatment is challenging. Thus, establishing an interdisciplinary 
team to create cardiovascular risk stratification clinical decision aids for 
integration into electronic health records for oncology patients was considered 
crucial.
DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Core team members from the Medical College of 
Wisconsin (MCW), University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM), and Milwaukee School 
of Engineering (MSOE), and additional members from Cleveland Clinic, Mayo 
Clinic, and other institutions have joined forces to apply high-performance 
computing in cardio-oncology.
RESULTS: The team is comprised of clinicians and researchers from relevant 
complementary and synergistic fields relevant to this work. The team has built 
an epidemiological cohort of ~5000 cancer survivors that will serve as a 
database for interdisciplinary multi-institutional artificial intelligence 
projects.
CONCLUSION: Lessons learned from establishing this team, as well as initial 
findings from the epidemiology cohort, are presented. Barriers have been broken 
down to form a multi-institutional interdisciplinary team for health informatics 
research in cardio-oncology. A database of cancer survivors has been created 
collaboratively by the team and provides initial insight into cardiovascular 
outcomes and comorbidities in this population.

Machine learning approaches, such as soft independent modeling of class analogy 
(SIMCA) and pathway analysis, were introduced in depression research in the 
1990s (Maes et al.) to construct neuroimmune endophenotype classes. The goal of 
this paper is to examine the promise of precision psychiatry to use information 
about a depressed person's own pan-omics, environmental, and lifestyle data, or 
to tailor preventative measures and medical treatments to endophenotype 
subgroups of depressed patients in order to achieve the best clinical outcome 
for each individual. Three steps are emerging in precision medicine: (1) the 
optimization and refining of classical models and constructing digital twins; 
(2) the use of precision medicine to construct endophenotype classes and pathway 
phenotypes, and (3) constructing a digital self of each patient. The root cause 
of why precision psychiatry cannot develop into true sciences is that there is 
no correct (cross-validated and reliable) model of clinical depression as a 
serious medical disorder discriminating it from a normal emotional distress 
response including sadness, grief and demoralization. Here, we explain how we 
used (un)supervised machine learning such as partial least squares path 
analysis, SIMCA and factor analysis to construct (a) a new precision depression 
model; (b) a new endophenotype class, namely major dysmood disorder (MDMD), 
which is a nosological class defined by severe symptoms and neuro-oxidative 
toxicity; and a new pathway phenotype, namely the reoccurrence of illness (ROI) 
index, which is a latent vector extracted from staging characteristics (number 
of depression and manic episodes and suicide attempts), and (c) an ideocratic 
profile with personalized scores based on all MDMD features.

Precision prevention of advanced melanoma is fast becoming a realistic prospect, 
with personalized, holistic risk stratification allowing patients to be directed 
to an appropriate level of surveillance, ranging from skin self-examinations to 
regular total body photography with sequential digital dermoscopic imaging. This 
approach aims to address both underdiagnosis (a missed or delayed melanoma 
diagnosis) and overdiagnosis (the diagnosis and treatment of indolent lesions 
that would not have caused a problem). Holistic risk stratification considers 
several types of melanoma risk factors: clinical phenotype, comprehensive 
imaging-based phenotype, familial and polygenic risks. Artificial intelligence 
computer-aided diagnostics combines these risk factors to produce a personalized 
risk score, and can also assist in assessing the digital and molecular markers 
of individual lesions. However, to ensure uptake and efficient use of AI 
systems, researchers will need to carefully consider how best to incorporate 
privacy and standardization requirements, and above all address consumer trust 
concerns.

Given the rapid increase in the incidence of cardiometabolic conditions, there 
is an urgent need for better approaches to prevent as many cases as possible and 
move from a one-size-fits-all approach to a precision cardiometabolic prevention 
strategy in the general population. We used data from ORISCAV-LUX 2, a 
nationwide, cross-sectional, population-based study. On the 1356 participants, 
we used a machine learning semi-supervised cluster method guided by body mass 
index (BMI) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and a set of 29 cardiometabolic 
variables, to identify subgroups of interest for cardiometabolic health. Cluster 
stability was assessed with the Jaccard similarity index. We have observed 4 
clusters with a very high stability (ranging between 92 and 100%). Based on 
distinctive features that deviate from the overall population distribution, we 
have labeled Cluster 1 (N = 729, 53.76%) as "Healthy", Cluster 2 (N = 508, 
37.46%) as "Family history-Overweight-High Cholesterol ", Cluster 3 (N = 91, 
6.71%) as "Severe Obesity-Prediabetes-Inflammation" and Cluster 4 (N = 28, 
2.06%) as "Diabetes-Hypertension-Poor CV Health". Our work provides an in-depth 
characterization and thus, a better understanding of cardiometabolic health in 
the general population. Our data suggest that such a clustering approach could 
now be used to define more targeted and tailored strategies for the prevention 
of cardiometabolic diseases at a population level. This study provides a first 
step towards precision cardiometabolic prevention and should be externally 
validated in other contexts.

Climate change, increasing populations, competing demands on land for production 
of biofuels and declining soil quality are challenging global food security. 
Finding sustainable solutions requires bold new approaches and integration of 
knowledge from diverse fields, such as materials science and informatics. The 
convergence of precision agriculture, in which farmers respond in real time to 
changes in crop growth with nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, offers 
exciting opportunities for sustainable food production. Coupling existing models 
for nutrient cycling and crop productivity with nanoinformatics approaches to 
optimize targeting, uptake, delivery, nutrient capture and long-term impacts on 
soil microbial communities will enable design of nanoscale agrochemicals that 
combine optimal safety and functionality profiles.

Since U.S. President Barack Obama announced the Precision Medicine Initiative in 
his New Year's State of the Union address in 2015, the establishment of a 
precision medicine system has been emphasized worldwide, particularly in the 
field of oncology. With the advent of next-generation sequencers specifically, 
genome analysis technology has made remarkable progress, and there are active 
efforts to apply genome information to diagnosis and treatment. Generally, in 
the process of feeding back the results of next-generation sequencing analysis 
to patients, a molecular tumor board (MTB), consisting of experts in clinical 
oncology, genetic medicine, etc., is established to discuss the results. On the 
other hand, an MTB currently involves a large amount of work, with humans 
searching through vast databases and literature, selecting the best drug 
candidates, and manually confirming the status of available clinical trials. In 
addition, as personalized medicine advances, the burden on MTB members is 
expected to increase in the future. Under these circumstances, introducing 
cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology and information and 
communication technology to MTBs while reducing the burden on MTB members and 
building a platform that enables more accurate and personalized medical care 
would be of great benefit to patients. In this review, we introduced the latest 
status of elemental technologies that have potential for AI utilization in MTB, 
and discussed issues that may arise in the future as we progress with AI 
implementation.

BACKGROUND: Psychotherapies for depression are equally effective on average, but 
individual responses vary widely. Outcomes can be improved by optimizing 
treatment selection using multivariate prediction models. A promising approach 
is the Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) that predicts the optimal treatment 
for a given individual and the magnitude of the advantage. The current study 
aimed to extend the PAI to long-term depression outcomes after acute-phase 
psychotherapy.
METHODS: Data come from a randomized trial comparing cognitive therapy (CT, n = 
76) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT, n = 75) for major depressive disorder 
(MDD). Primary outcome was depression severity, as assessed by the BDI-II, 
during 17-month follow-up. First, predictors and moderators were selected from 
38 pre-treatment variables using a two-step machine learning approach. Second, 
predictors and moderators were combined into a final model, from which PAI 
predictions were computed with cross-validation. Long-term PAI predictions were 
then compared to actual follow-up outcomes and post-treatment PAI predictions.
RESULTS: One predictor (parental alcohol abuse) and two moderators (recent life 
events; childhood maltreatment) were identified. Individuals assigned to their 
PAI-indicated treatment had lower follow-up depression severity compared to 
those assigned to their PAI-non-indicated treatment. This difference was 
significant in two subsets of the overall sample: those whose PAI score was in 
the upper 60%, and those whose PAI indicated CT, irrespective of magnitude. 
Long-term predictions did not overlap substantially with predictions for acute 
benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: If replicated, long-term PAI predictions could enhance precision 
medicine by selecting the optimal treatment for a given depressed individual 
over the long term.

Early identification of coronary atherosclerotic pathogenic mechanisms is useful 
for predicting the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and future cardiac 
events. Epigenome changes may clarify a significant fraction of this "missing 
hereditability", thus offering novel potential biomarkers for prevention and 
care of CHD. The rapidly growing disciplines of systems biology and network 
science are now poised to meet the fields of precision medicine and personalized 
therapy. Network medicine integrates standard clinical recording and 
non-invasive, advanced cardiac imaging tools with epigenetics into deep learning 
for in-depth CHD molecular phenotyping. This approach could potentially explore 
developing novel drugs from natural compounds (i.e. polyphenols, folic acid) and 
repurposing current drugs, such as statins and metformin. Several clinical 
trials have exploited epigenetic tags and epigenetic sensitive drugs both in 
primary and secondary prevention. Due to their stability in plasma and easiness 
of detection, many ongoing clinical trials are focused on the evaluation of 
circulating miRNAs (e.g. miR-8059 and miR-320a) in blood, in association with 
imaging parameters such as coronary calcifications and stenosis degree detected 
by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), or functional parameters 
provided by FFR/CT and PET/CT. Although epigenetic modifications have also been 
prioritized through network based approaches, the whole set of molecular 
interactions (interactome) in CHD is still under investigation for primary 
prevention strategies.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex, 
heterogeneous syndrome in need of improved classification given its high 
morbidity and mortality and few effective treatment options. HFpEF represents an 
ideal setting to examine the utility and feasibility of a precision medicine 
approach. This article (based on the 20th annual Feigenbaum Lecture, presented 
at the 2019 American Society of Echocardiography Scientific Sessions) describes 
the utility of echocardiography as a "digital biopsy" and how deep quantitative 
echocardiographic phenotyping, coupled with machine learning, can be used to 
identify novel HFpEF phenotypes. The cellular and ultrastructural basis of 
abnormal speckle-tracking echocardiography- (STE-) based measurements of cardiac 
mechanics can provide a window into cardiomyocyte calcium homeostasis. STE-based 
measurements of longitudinal strain can thus inform the extent of myocardial 
involvement in patients with HFpEF, which may help to determine responsiveness 
to cardiac-specific HF medications. However, classifying the complex, systemic, 
multiorgan nature of HFpEF appropriately likely requires more advanced methods. 
Using unsupervised machine learning, HFpEF can be classified into three distinct 
phenogroups with differing clinical and echocardiographic characteristics and 
outcomes: (1) natriuretic peptide deficiency syndrome; (2) extreme 
cardiometabolic syndrome; and (3) right ventricle-cardio-abdomino-renal 
syndrome. Each can be probed to determine their biological basis. The goal of 
improved classification of HFpEF is to match the right patient with the right 
treatment, with the hope of improving the track record of HFpEF clinical trials. 
This article emphasizes the central role of echocardiography in advancing 
precision medicine and illustrates the integration of basic, translational, 
clinical, and population research in echocardiography with the goal of better 
understanding the pathobiology of a complex cardiovascular syndrome.

Clinical decision making for Parkinson's disease patients is supported by a 
combination of three distinct information resources: best available scientific 
evidence, professional expertise, and the personal needs and preferences of 
patients. All three sources have clear value but also share several important 
limitations, mainly regarding subjectivity, generalizability and variability. 
For example, current scientific evidence, especially from controlled clinical 
trials, is often based on selected study populations, making it difficult to 
translate the outcome to the care for individual patients in everyday clinical 
practice. Big data, including data from real-life unselected Parkinson 
populations, can help to bridge this information gap. Fine-grained patient 
profiles created from big data have the potential to aid in identifying 
therapeutic approaches that will be most effective given each patient's 
individual characteristics, which is particularly important for a disorder 
characterized by such tremendous interindividual variability as Parkinson's 
disease. In this viewpoint, we argue that big data approaches should be 
acknowledged and harnessed, not to replace existing information resources, but 
rather as a fourth and complimentary source of information in clinical decision 
making, helping to represent the full complexity of individual patients. We 
introduce the 'quadruple decision making' model and illustrate its mode of 
action by showing how this can be used to pursue precision medicine for persons 
living with Parkinson's disease.

Purpose: Predicting patients' survival outcomes is recognized of key importance 
to clinicians in oncology toward determining an ideal course of treatment and 
patient management. This study applies radiomics analysis on pre-operative 
multi-parametric MRI of patients with glioblastoma from multiple institutions to 
identify a signature and a practical machine learning model for stratifying 
patients into groups based on overall survival. Methods: This study included 163 
patients' data with glioblastoma, collected by BRATS 2018 Challenge from 
multiple institutions. In this proposed method, a set of 147 radiomics image 
features were extracted locally from three tumor sub-regions on standardized 
pre-operative multi-parametric MR images. LASSO regression was applied for 
identifying an informative subset of chosen features whereas a Cox model used to 
obtain the coefficients of those selected features. Then, a radiomics signature 
model of 9 features was constructed on the discovery set and it performance was 
evaluated for patients stratification into short- (<10 months), medium- (10-15 
months), and long-survivors (>15 months) groups. Eight ML classification models, 
trained and then cross-validated, were tested to assess a range of survival 
prediction performance as a function of the choice of features. Results: The 
proposed mpMRI radiomics signature model had a statistically significant 
association with survival (P < 0.001) in the training set, but was not confirmed 
(P = 0.110) in the validation cohort. Its performance in the validation set had 
a sensitivity of 0.476 (short-), 0.231 (medium-), and 0.600 (long-survivors), 
and specificity of 0.667 (short-), 0.732 (medium-), and 0.794 (long-survivors). 
Among the tested ML classifiers, the ensemble learning model's results showed 
superior performance in predicting the survival classes, with an overall 
accuracy of 57.8% and AUC of 0.81 for short-, 0.47 for medium-, and 0.72 for 
long-survivors using the LASSO selected features combined with clinical factors. 
Conclusion: A derived GLCM feature, representing intra-tumoral inhomogeneity, 
was found to have a high association with survival. Clinical factors, when added 
to the radiomics image features, boosted the performance of the ML 
classification model in predicting individual glioblastoma patient's survival 
prognosis, which can improve prognostic quality a further step toward precision 
oncology.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The 'precision medicine' refers to the generation of 
identification and classification criteria for advanced taxonomy of patients, 
exploiting advanced models to infer optimized clinical decisions for each 
disease phenotype.
RECENT FINDINGS: The current article reviews new advances in the past 18 months 
on the microbiomics science intended as new discipline contributing to advanced 
'precision medicine'. Recently published data highlight the importance of 
multidimensional data in the description of deep disease phenotypes, including 
microbiome and immune profiling, and support the efficacy of the systems 
medicine to better stratify patients, hence optimizing diagnostics, clinical 
management and response to treatments.
SUMMARY: The articles referenced in this review help inform the reader on new 
decision-support systems that can be based on multiomics patients' data 
including microbiome and immune profiling. These harmonized and integrated data 
can be elaborated by artificial intelligence to generate optimized diagnostic 
pipelines and clinical interventions.

This paper presents an improved solution for detecting gestures with a better 
precision using the Leap Motion sensor and Machine Learning support. A neural 
network is trained to recognize a hand rotation gesture expressing the grade of 
recovery, with a supination and pronation exercise. The supination-pronation 
movement is divided into 4 levels because the users are not usually able to 
perform a complete rotation gesture in hand recovery after injury. The neural 
network is trained with data representing the hand rotation angle measurements 
on the x, y and z axes. The Neural Network training is based on the Tensorflow 
library. 3 tests were carried out to test the network and eventually a 96% 
gesture-detection accuracy was achieved.

BACKGROUND: Both the frequency and high complication rates associated with 
extremity wounds in recent military conflicts have highlighted the need for 
clinical decision support tools (CDST) to decrease time to wound closure and 
wound failure rates.
METHODS: Machine learning was used to estimate both successful wound closure 
(based on penultimate debridement biomarker data) and the necessary number of 
surgical debridements (based on presentation biomarkers) in 73 service members 
treated according to military guidelines based on clinical data and the 
local/systemic level of 32 cytokines. Models were trained to estimate successful 
closure including an additional 8 of 80 civilian patients with similar injury 
patterns. Previous analysis has demonstrated the potential to reduce the number 
of operative debridements by 2, with resulting decreases in ICU and hospital 
LOS, while decreasing the rate of wound failure.
RESULTS: Analysis showed similar cytokine responses when civilians followed a 
military-like treatment schedule with surgical debridements every 24 to 
72 hours. A model estimating successful closure had AUC of 0.89. Model 
performance in civilians degraded when these had a debridement interval > 72 
hours (73 of the 80 civilians). A separate model estimating the number of 
debridements required to achieve successful closure had a multiclass AUC of 
0.81.
CONCLUSION: CDSTs can be developed using biologically compatible civilian and 
military populations as cytokine response is highly influenced by surgical 
treatment. Our CDSTs may help identify who may require serial debridements 
versus early closure, and precisely when traumatic wounds should optimally be 
closed.

Efforts to provide patients with individualized treatments have led to 
tremendous breakthroughs in healthcare. However, a precision medicine approach 
alone will not offset the rapid increase in prevalence and burden of chronic 
non-communicable illnesses that is continuing to pervade the world's aging 
population. With rapid advances in technology, it is now possible to collect 
digital metrics to assess, monitor and detect chronic disease indicators, much 
earlier in the disease course, potentially redefining what was previously 
considered asymptomatic to pre-symptomatic. Data science and artificial 
intelligence can drive the discovery of digital biomarkers before the emergence 
of overt clinical symptoms, thereby transforming the current healthcare approach 
from one centered on precision medicine to a more comprehensive focus on 
precision health, and by doing so enable the possibility of preventing disease 
altogether. Presented herein are the challenges to the current healthcare model 
and the proposition of first steps for reversing the prevailing intractable 
trend of rising healthcare costs and poorer health quality.

Classification of variants of unknown significance is a challenging technical 
problem in clinical genetics. As up to one-third of disease-causing mutations 
are thought to affect pre-mRNA splicing, it is important to accurately classify 
splicing mutations in patient sequencing data. Several consortia and healthcare 
systems have conducted large-scale patient sequencing studies, which discover 
novel variants faster than they can be classified. Here, we compare the 
advantages and limitations of several high-throughput splicing assays aimed at 
mitigating this bottleneck, and describe a data set of ~5,000 variants that we 
analyzed using our Massively Parallel Splicing Assay (MaPSy). The Critical 
Assessment of Genome Interpretation group (CAGI) organized a challenge, in which 
participants submitted machine learning models to predict the splicing effects 
of variants in this data set. We discuss the winning submission of the challenge 
(MMSplice) which outperformed existing software. Finally, we highlight methods 
to overcome the limitations of MaPSy and similar assays, such as tissue-specific 
splicing, the effect of surrounding sequence context, classifying intronic 
variants, synthesizing large exons, and amplifying complex libraries of minigene 
species. Further development of these assays will greatly benefit the field of 
clinical genetics, which lack high-throughput methods for variant 
interpretation.

Clinical trials have identified a variety of predictor variables for use in 
precision treatment protocols, ranging from clinical biomarkers and symptom 
profiles to self-report measures of various sorts. Although such variables are 
informative collectively, none has proven sufficiently powerful to guide optimal 
treatment selection individually. This has prompted growing interest in the 
development of composite precision treatment rules (PTRs) that are constructed 
by combining information across a range of predictors. But this work has been 
hampered by the generally small samples in randomized clinical trials and the 
use of suboptimal analysis methods to analyze the resulting data. In this paper, 
we propose to address the sample size problem by: working with large 
observational electronic medical record databases rather than controlled 
clinical trials to develop preliminary PTRs; validating these preliminary PTRs 
in subsequent pragmatic trials; and using ensemble machine learning methods 
rather than individual algorithms to carry out statistical analyses to develop 
the PTRs. The major challenges in this proposed approach are that treatment are 
not randomly assigned in observational databases and that these databases often 
lack measures of key prescriptive predictors and mental disorder treatment 
outcomes. We proposed a tiered case-cohort design approach that uses innovative 
methods for measuring and balancing baseline covariates and estimating PTRs to 
address these challenges.

Small-bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common and important disease, for which 
machine learning tools have yet to be developed. Image annotation is a critical 
first step for development of such tools. This study assesses whether image 
annotation by eye tracking is sufficiently accurate and precise to serve as a 
first step in the development of machine learning tools for detection of SBO on 
CT. Seven subjects diagnosed with SBO by CT were included in the study. For each 
subject, an obstructed segment of bowel was chosen. Three observers annotated 
the centerline of the segment by manual fiducial placement and by visual 
fiducial placement using a Tobii 4c eye tracker. Each annotation was repeated 
three times. The distance between centerlines was calculated after alignment 
using dynamic time warping (DTW) and statistically compared to clinical 
thresholds for diagnosis of SBO. Intra-observer DTW distance between manual and 
visual centerlines was calculated as a measure of accuracy. These distances were 
1.1 ± 0.2, 1.3 ± 0.4, and 1.8 ± 0.2 cm for the three observers and were less 
than 1.5 cm for two of three observers (P < 0.01). Intra- and inter-observer DTW 
distances between centerlines placed with each method were calculated as 
measures of precision. These distances were 0.6 ± 0.1 and 0.8 ± 0.2 cm for 
manual centerlines, 1.1 ± 0.4 and 1.9 ± 0.6 cm for visual centerlines, and were 
less than 3.0 cm in all cases (P < 0.01). Results suggest that eye 
tracking-based annotation is sufficiently accurate and precise for small-bowel 
centerline annotation for use in machine learning-based applications.

Involvement from the dermatology community in the current revolution in sensors, 
personal health devices, computing, and machine learning algorithms can enable 
us to reach the promise of precision medicine in dermatology to deliver the 
'right treatment at the right time'. Machine learning combined with digital 
health technology offers enormous potential to expand access to dermatological 
services, engage patients in the management of their conditions, and provide 
tools that enable clinicians to be more effective in their delivery of health 
care. We offer our framework for how machine learning, rather than replacing 
dermatologists, will be essential in realizing the promise of precision 
dermatology.

Although machine learning models are increasingly being developed for clinical 
decision support for patients with type 2 diabetes, the adoption of these models 
into clinical practice remains limited. Currently, machine learning (ML) models 
are being constructed on local healthcare systems and are validated internally 
with no expectation that they would validate externally and thus, are rarely 
transferrable to a different healthcare system. In this work, we aim to 
demonstrate that (1) even a complex ML model built on a national cohort can be 
transferred to two local healthcare systems, (2) while a model constructed on a 
local healthcare system's cohort is difficult to transfer; (3) we examine the 
impact of training cohort size on the transferability; and (4) we discuss 
criteria for external validity. We built a model using our previously published 
Multi-Task Learning-based methodology on a national cohort extracted from 
OptumLabs® Data Warehouse and transferred the model to two local healthcare 
systems (i.e., University of Minnesota Medical Center and Mayo Clinic) for 
external evaluation. The model remained valid when applied to the local patient 
populations and performed as well as locally constructed models (concordance: 
.73-.92), demonstrating transferability. The performance of the locally 
constructed models reduced substantially when applied to each other's healthcare 
system (concordance: .62-.90). We believe that our modeling approach, in which a 
model is learned from a national cohort and is externally validated, produces a 
transferable model, allowing patients at smaller healthcare systems to benefit 
from precision medicine.

Precision medicine is part of five focus areas of the Challenges in IBD research 
document, which also includes preclinical human IBD mechanisms, environmental 
triggers, novel technologies, and pragmatic clinical research. The Challenges in 
IBD Research document provides a comprehensive overview of current gaps in 
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) research and delivers actionable approaches to 
address them. It is the result of a multidisciplinary input from scientists, 
clinicians, patients, and funders, and represents a valuable resource for 
patient centric research prioritization. In particular, the precision medicine 
section is focused on highlighting the main gap areas that must be addressed to 
get closer to treatments tailored to the biological and clinical characteristics 
of each patient, which is the aim of precision medicine. The main gaps were 
identified in: 1) understanding and predicting the natural history of IBD: 
disease susceptibility, activity, and behavior; 2) predicting disease course and 
treatment response; and 3) optimizing current and developing new molecular 
technologies. Suggested approaches to bridge these gaps include prospective 
longitudinal cohort studies to identify and validate precision biomarkers for 
prognostication of disease course, and prediction and monitoring of treatment 
response. To achieve this, harmonization across studies is key as well as 
development of standardized methods and infrastructure. The implementation of 
state-of-the-art molecular technologies, systems biology and machine learning 
approaches for multi-omics and clinical data integration and analysis will be 
also fundamental. Finally, randomized biomarker-stratified trials will be 
critical to evaluate the clinical utility of validated signatures and biomarkers 
in improving patient outcomes and cost-effective care.

The complexity of modern multi-parametric MRI has increasingly challenged 
conventional interpretations of such images. Machine learning has emerged as a 
powerful approach to integrating diverse and complex imaging data into 
signatures of diagnostic and predictive value. It has also allowed us to 
progress from group comparisons to imaging biomarkers that offer value on an 
individual basis. We review several directions of research around this topic, 
emphasizing the use of machine learning in personalized predictions of clinical 
outcome, in breaking down broad umbrella diagnostic categories into more 
detailed and precise subtypes, and in non-invasively estimating cancer molecular 
characteristics. These methods and studies contribute to the field of precision 
medicine, by introducing more specific diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of

Identification of effective drug combinations for patients is an expensive and 
time-consuming procedure, especially for in vitro experiments. To accelerate the 
synergistic drug discovery process, we present a new classification model to 
identify more effective anti-cancer drug pairs using in silico network biology 
approach. Based on the hypotheses that the drug synergy comes from the 
collective effects on the biological network, therefore, we developed six 
network biology features, including overlap and distance of drug perturbation 
network, that were derived by using individual drug-perturbed transcriptome 
profiles and the relevant biological network analysis. Using publicly available 
drug synergy databases and three machine-learning (ML) methods, the model was 
trained to discriminate the positive (synergistic) and negative (nonsynergistic) 
drug combinations. The proposed models were evaluated on the test cases to 
predict the most promising network biology feature, which is the network degree 
activity, i.e. the synergistic effect between drug pairs is mainly accounted by 
the complementary signaling pathways or molecular networks from two drugs.

Chronic disease now affects approximately half of the US population, causes 7 in 
10 deaths, and accounts for roughly 80% of US health care expenditure. Because 
the root causes of chronic diseases are largely behavioral, effective therapies 
require frequent, individualized interventions that extend beyond the hospital 
and clinic to reach patients in their day-to-day lives. However, a mismatch 
currently exists between what the health care system is equipped to provide and 
the interventions necessary to effectively address the chronic disease burden. 
To remedy this health crisis, we present an individualized, data-driven digital 
approach for chronic disease management and prevention through precision 
behavior change. The rapid growth of information, biological, and communication 
technologies makes this an opportune time to develop digital tools that deliver 
precision interventions for health behavior change to address the chronic 
disease crisis. Building on this rapid growth, we propose a framework that 
includes the precise targeting of risk-producing behaviors using real-time 
sensing technology, machine learning data analysis to identify the most 
effective intervention, and delivery of that intervention with 
health-reinforcing feedback to provide real-time, individualized support to 
empower sustainable health behavior change.

Precision medicine (PM) is an evolving scientific renaissance movement 
implementing key breakthrough technological and scientific advances to overcome 
the limitations of traditional symptom- and sign-based phenotypic diagnoses and 
clinical "one-size-fits-all, magic bullet drug development" in these largely 
heterogeneous target populations. It is a conceptual shift from ineffective 
treatments for biologically heterogeneous "population averages" to 
individually-tailored biomarker-guided targeted therapies. PM is defining which 
therapeutic approach will be the most effective for a specific individual, at a 
determined disease stage, across multiple medical research fields, including 
neuroscience, neurology and psychiatry. The launch of the Alzheimer Precision 
Medicine Initiative (APMI) and its associated cohort program in 2016-facilitated 
by the academic core coordinating center run by the Sorbonne University Clinical 
Research Group in Alzheimer Precision Medicine (Sorbonne University GRC n°21 
APM)"-is geared at transforming healthcare, conventional clinical diagnostics, 
and drug development research in Alzheimer's disease. Ever since the 
commencement of the APMI, the international interdisciplinary research network 
has introduced groundbreaking translational neuroscience programs on the basis 
of agnostic exploratory genomics, systems biology, and systems neurophysiology 
applying innovative "big data science", including breakthrough artificial 
intelligence-based algorithms. Here, we present the scientific breakthrough 
advances and the pillars of the theoretical and conceptual development leading 
to the APMI.

BACKGROUND: Depression causes significant physical and psychosocial morbidity. 
Predicting persistence of depressive symptoms could permit targeted prevention, 
and lessen the burden of depression. Machine learning is a rapidly expanding 
field, and such approaches offer powerful predictive abilities. We investigated 
the utility of a machine learning approach to predict the persistence of 
depressive symptoms in older adults.
METHOD: Baseline demographic and psychometric data from 284 patients were used 
to predict the likelihood of older adults having persistent depressive symptoms 
after 12 months, using a machine learning approach ('extreme gradient 
boosting'). Predictive performance was compared to a conventional statistical 
approach (logistic regression). Data were drawn from the 'treatment-as-usual' 
arm of the CASPER (CollAborative care and active surveillance for 
Screen-Positive EldeRs with subthreshold depression) trial.
RESULTS: Predictive performance was superior using machine learning compared to 
logistic regression (mean AUC 0.72 vs. 0.67, p < 0.0001). Using machine 
learning, an average of 89% of those predicted to have PHQ-9 scores above 
threshold at 12 months actually did, compared to 78% using logistic regression. 
However, mean negative predictive values were somewhat lower for the machine 
learning approach (45% vs. 35%).
LIMITATIONS: A relatively small sample size potentially limited the predictive 
power of the algorithm. In addition, PHQ-9 scores were used as an indicator of 
persistent depressive symptoms, and whilst well validated, a clinical interview 
would have been preferable.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings support the potential application of machine 
learning in personalised mental healthcare.

How can biophysical principles help precision medicine identify rare driver 
mutations? A major tenet of pragmatic approaches to precision oncology and 
pharmacology is that driver mutations are very frequent. However, frequency is a 
statistical attribute, not a mechanistic one. Rare mutations can also act 
through the same mechanism, and as we discuss below, "latent driver" mutations 
may also follow the same route, with "helper" mutations. Here, we review how 
biophysics provides mechanistic guidelines that extend precision medicine. We 
outline principles and strategies, especially focusing on mutations that drive 
cancer. Biophysics has contributed profoundly to deciphering biological 
processes. However, driven by data science, precision medicine has skirted some 
of its major tenets. Data science embodies genomics, tissue- and cell-specific 
expression levels, making it capable of defining genome- and systems-wide 
molecular disease signatures. It classifies cancer driver genes/mutations and 
affected pathways, and its associated protein structural data guide drug 
discovery. Biophysics complements data science. It considers structures and 
their heterogeneous ensembles, explains how mutational variants can signal 
through distinct pathways, and how allo-network drugs can be harnessed. 
Biophysics clarifies how one mutation-frequent or rare-can affect multiple 
phenotypic traits by populating conformations that favor interactions with other 
network modules. It also suggests how to identify such mutations and their 
signaling consequences. Biophysics offers principles and strategies that can 
help precision medicine push the boundaries to transform our insight into 
biological processes and the practice of personalized medicine. By contrast, 
"phenotypic drug discovery," which capitalizes on physiological cellular 
conditions and first-in-class drug discovery, may not capture the proper 
molecular variant. This is because variants of the same protein can express more 
than one phenotype, and a phenotype can be encoded by several variants.

Recently, in a medical field, quantitative data mining is a hot topic for 
performing a precision (or personalized) medicine. Although a molecular 
biological data has been mainly utilized for data mining in this field, medical 
images are also important minable data. Radiomics is a comprehensive analysis 
methodology for describing tumor phenotypes or molecular biological expressions 
(e.g. genotypes) using minable feature extracted from a large number of medical 
images. In this review paper, we introduce to a framework of the radiomics.

More reliable and cheaper sequencing technologies have revealed the vast 
mutational landscapes characteristic of many phenotypes. The analysis of such 
genetic variants has led to successful identification of altered proteins 
underlying many Mendelian disorders. Nevertheless the simple one-variant 
one-phenotype model valid for many monogenic diseases does not capture the 
complexity of polygenic traits and disorders. Although experimental and 
computational approaches have improved detection of functionally deleterious 
variants and important interactions between gene products, the development of 
comprehensive models relating genotype and phenotypes remains a challenge in the 
field of genomic medicine. In this context, a new view of the pathologic state 
as significant perturbation of the network of interactions between biomolecules 
is crucial for the identification of biochemical pathways associated with 
complex phenotypes. Seminal studies in systems biology combined the analysis of 
genetic variation with protein-protein interaction networks to demonstrate that 
even as biological systems evolve to be robust to genetic variation, their 
topologies create disease vulnerabilities. More recent analyses model the impact 
of genetic variants as changes to the "wiring" of the interactome to better 
capture heterogeneity in genotype-phenotype relationships. These studies lay the 
foundation for using networks to predict variant effects at scale using 
machine-learning or algorithmic approaches. A wealth of databases and resources 
for the annotation of genotype-phenotype relationships have been developed to 
support developments in this area. This overview describes how study of the 
molecular interactome has generated insights linking the organization of 
biological systems to disease mechanism, and how this information can enable 
precision medicine. This article is categorized under: Translational, Genomic,

Cervical cancer is a complex disease caused by both genetic susceptibility and 
environmental factors. Inherited genomic variance, high-risk human papilloma 
virus (HPV) infection/integration, genome methylation and somatic mutation could 
all constitute one machine learning model, laying the ground for molecular 
classification and the precision medicine of cervical cancer. Therefore, for 
cervical screening, next generation sequencing (NGS)-based HPV DNA and other 
molecular tests as well as dynamic machine learning models would accurately 
predict patients with potential to develop the cancer, thereby reducing the 
burden of repeated screening. Meantime, genome-editing tools targeting HPV would 
emerge as the next generation gene therapy for HPV-related cervical lesions. In 
this article, we review the substantial progress on molecular mechanism of 
cervical cancer development and suggest the future for precise prevention and 
early treatment of cervical cancer.

BACKGROUND: Nowadays, the increasing availability of omics data, due to both the 
advancements in the acquisition of molecular biology results and in systems 
biology simulation technologies, provides the bases for precision medicine. 
Success in precision medicine depends on the access to healthcare and biomedical 
data. To this end, the digitization of all clinical exams and medical records is 
becoming a standard in hospitals. The digitization is essential to collect, 
share, and aggregate large volumes of heterogeneous data to support the 
discovery of hidden patterns with the aim to define predictive models for 
biomedical purposes. Patients' data sharing is a critical process. In fact, it 
raises ethical, social, legal, and technological issues that must be properly 
addressed.
RESULTS: In this work, we present an infrastructure devised to deal with the 
integration of large volumes of heterogeneous biological data. The 
infrastructure was applied to the data collected between 2010-2016 in one of the 
major diagnostic analysis laboratories in Italy. Data from three different 
platforms were collected (i.e., laboratory exams, pathological anatomy exams, 
biopsy exams). The infrastructure has been designed to allow the extraction and 
aggregation of both unstructured and semi-structured data. Data are properly 
treated to ensure data security and privacy. Specialized algorithms have also 
been implemented to process the aggregated information with the aim to obtain a 
precise historical analysis of the clinical activities of one or more patients. 
Moreover, three Bayesian classifiers have been developed to analyze examinations 
reported as free text. Experimental results show that the classifiers exhibit a 
good accuracy when used to analyze sentences related to the sample location, 
diseases presence and status of the illnesses.
CONCLUSIONS: The infrastructure allows the integration of multiple and 
heterogeneous sources of anonymized data from the different clinical platforms. 
Both unstructured and semi-structured data are processed to obtain a precise 
historical analysis of the clinical activities of one or more patients. Data 
aggregation allows to perform a series of statistical assessments required to 
answer complex questions that can be used in a variety of fields, such as 
predictive and precision medicine. In particular, studying the clinical history 
of patients that have developed similar pathologies can help to predict or 
individuate markers able to allow an early diagnosis of possible illnesses.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability of a novel live primary-cell phenotypic (LPCP) 
test to predict postsurgical adverse pathology (P-SAP) features and risk 
stratify patients based on SAP features in a blinded study utilizing radical 
prostatectomy (RP) surgical specimens.
METHODS: Two hundred fifty-one men undergoing RP were enrolled in a prospective, 
multicenter (10), and proof-of-concept study in the United States. Fresh 
prostate samples were taken from known areas of cancer in the operating room 
immediately after RP. Samples were shipped and tested at a central laboratory. 
Utilizing the LPCP test, a suite of phenotypic biomarkers was analyzed and 
quantified using objective machine vision software. Biomarkers were objectively 
ranked via machine learning-derived statistical algorithms (MLDSA) to predict 
postsurgical adverse pathological features. Sensitivity and specificity were 
determined by comparing blinded predictions and unblinded RP surgical pathology 
reports, training MLDSAs on 70% of biopsy cells and testing MLDSAs on the 
remaining 30% of biopsy cells across the tested patient population.
RESULTS: The LPCP test predicted adverse pathologies post-RP with area under the 
curve (AUC) via receiver operating characteristics analysis of greater than 0.80 
and distinguished between Prostate Cancer Grade Groups 1, 2, and 3/Gleason 
Scores 3 + 3, 3 + 4, and 4 + 3. Further, LPCP derived-biomarker scores predicted 
Gleason pattern, stage, and adverse pathology with high precision-AUCs>0.80.
CONCLUSION: Using MLDSA-derived phenotypic biomarker scores, the LPCP test 
successfully risk stratified Prostate Cancer Grade Groups 1, 2, and 3 (Gleason 
3 + 3 and 7) into distinct subgroups predicted to have surgical adverse 
pathologies or not with high performance (>0.85 AUC).

In recent years, the therapeutic management of selected patients with cancer has 
shifted toward the 'precision medicine' approach based on patient's mechanisms 
of tumorigenesis, and their baseline characteristics and comorbidities. Complete 
tumor and cell-free DNA profiling using next-generation sequencing, proteomic 
and RNA analysis, and immune mechanisms should to be taken into consideration 
and accurate bioinformatic analysis is essential to optimize patient's 
treatment. Areas covered: The challenges and opportunities of conducting 
clinical trials in precision oncology are summarized. Expert commentary: 
Precision medicine has significantly changed the diagnostic and therapeutic 
landscape of cancer. Successful implementation of precision medicine requires 
translational and bioinformatics infrastructure to support optimization of 
treatment selection. Targeted therapy, immunotherapy, T-cell therapy alone or in 
combination with cytotoxic or other effective therapeutic strategies and 
innovative clinical trials with adaptive design should be offered to all 
patients. Data sharing and 'N-of-1' models hold the promise to optimize the 
treatment of individual patients and expedite drug approval for rare alterations 
and tumor types. Artificial intelligence will facilitate accurate utilization of 
sequencing data to perform algorithm analysis. Collaboration of healthcare 
providers with pharmaceutical and biotechnical companies, scientific 
organizations, and governmental regulatory agencies have a crucial role in 
curing cancer.

Automated conversational agents built with medical applications in mind, have 
the potential to reduce healthcare readmissions and improve accessibility to 
medical knowledge. In this work, we demonstrate the development and evaluation 
of an automated chatbot for triage and conditions assessment, based on user 
inputs in natural language. The implemented bot engages patients in conversation 
about symptoms experienced and provides a personalized pre-synopsis based on 
their symptoms and profile. Our chatbot system was able to predict user 
conditions correctly based on two sets of patient test cases with an average 
precision of 0.82. Our implementation demonstrates that a medical chatbot can 
help with automatic triage and pre-assessment of patients with simple symptom 
analysis and a conversational approach without the use of cumbersome form-based 
data entry.

Big clinical data analytics as a primary component of precision medicine is 
discussed, identifying where these emerging tools fit in the spectrum of 
genomics and radiomics research. A learning health system (LHS) is 
conceptualized that uses clinically acquired data with machine learning to 
advance the initiatives of precision medicine. The LHS is comprehensive and can 
be used for clinical decision support, discovery, and hypothesis derivation. 
These developing uses can positively impact the ultimate management and 
therapeutic course for patients. The conceptual model for each use of clinical 
data, however, is different, and an overview of the implications is discussed. 
With advancements in technologies and culture to improve the efficiency, 
accuracy, and breadth of measurements of the patient condition, the concept of 
an LHS may be realized in precision radiation therapy.

Tumor precision medicine is an emerging approach for tumor diagnosis, treatment 
and prevention, which takes account of individual variability of environment, 
lifestyle and genetic information. Tumor precision medicine is built up on the 
medical imaging innovations developed during the past decades, including the new 
hardware, new imaging agents, standardized protocols, image analysis and 
multimodal imaging fusion technology. Also the development of automated and 
reproducible analysis algorithm has extracted large amount of information from 
image-based features. With the continuous development and mining of tumor 
clinical and imaging databases, the radiogenomics, radiomics and artificial 
intelligence have been flourishing. Therefore, these new technological advances 
bring new opportunities and challenges to the application of imaging in tumor 
precision medicine.

Precision animal agriculture is poised to rise to prominence in the livestock 
enterprise in the domains of management, production, welfare, sustainability, 
health surveillance, and environmental footprint. Considerable progress has been 
made in the use of tools to routinely monitor and collect information from 
animals and farms in a less laborious manner than before. These efforts have 
enabled the animal sciences to embark on information technology-driven 
discoveries to improve animal agriculture. However, the growing amount and 
complexity of data generated by fully automated, high-throughput data recording 
or phenotyping platforms, including digital images, sensor and sound data, 
unmanned systems, and information obtained from real-time noninvasive computer 
vision, pose challenges to the successful implementation of precision animal 
agriculture. The emerging fields of machine learning and data mining are 
expected to be instrumental in helping meet the daunting challenges facing 
global agriculture. Yet, their impact and potential in "big data" analysis have 
not been adequately appreciated in the animal science community, where this 
recognition has remained only fragmentary. To address such knowledge gaps, this 
article outlines a framework for machine learning and data mining and offers a 
glimpse into how they can be applied to solve pressing problems in animal 
sciences.

The growth of multiparametric imaging protocols has paved the way for 
quantitative imaging phenotypes that predict treatment response and clinical 
outcome, reflect underlying cancer molecular characteristics and spatiotemporal 
heterogeneity, and can guide personalized treatment planning. This growth has 
underlined the need for efficient quantitative analytics to derive 
high-dimensional imaging signatures of diagnostic and predictive value in this 
emerging era of integrated precision diagnostics. This paper presents cancer 
imaging phenomics toolkit (CaPTk), a new and dynamically growing software 
platform for analysis of radiographic images of cancer, currently focusing on 
brain, breast, and lung cancer. CaPTk leverages the value of quantitative 
imaging analytics along with machine learning to derive phenotypic imaging 
signatures, based on two-level functionality. First, image analysis algorithms 
are used to extract comprehensive panels of diverse and complementary features, 
such as multiparametric intensity histogram distributions, texture, shape, 
kinetics, connectomics, and spatial patterns. At the second level, these 
quantitative imaging signatures are fed into multivariate machine learning 
models to produce diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Results 
from clinical studies in three areas are shown: (i) computational neuro-oncology 
of brain gliomas for precision diagnostics, prediction of outcome, and treatment 
planning; (ii) prediction of treatment response for breast and lung cancer, and 
(iii) risk assessment for breast cancer.

Precision medicine was conceptualized on the strength of genomic sequence 
analysis. High-throughput functional metrics have enhanced sequence 
interpretation and clinical precision. These technologies include metabolomics, 
magnetic resonance imaging, and I rhythm (cardiac monitoring), among others. 
These technologies are discussed and placed in clinical context for the medical 
specialties of internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, and gynecology. 
Publications in these fields support the concept of a higher level of precision 
in identifying disease risk. Precise disease risk identification has the 
potential to enable intervention with greater specificity, resulting in disease 
prevention-an important goal of precision medicine.

Cancer drug therapies are only effective in a small proportion of patients. To 
make things worse, our ability to identify these responsive patients before 
administering a treatment is generally very limited. The recent arrival of 
large-scale pharmacogenomic data sets, which measure the sensitivity of 
molecularly profiled cancer cell lines to a panel of drugs, has boosted research 
on the discovery of drug sensitivity markers. However, no systematic comparison 
of widely-used single-gene markers with multi-gene machine-learning markers 
exploiting genomic data has been so far conducted. We therefore assessed the 
performance offered by these two types of models in discriminating between 
sensitive and resistant cell lines to a given drug. This was carried out for 
each of 127 considered drugs using genomic data characterising the cell lines. 
We found that the proportion of cell lines predicted to be sensitive that are 
actually sensitive (precision) varies strongly with the drug and type of model 
used. Furthermore, the proportion of sensitive cell lines that are correctly 
predicted as sensitive (recall) of the best single-gene marker was lower than 
that of the multi-gene marker in 118 of the 127 tested drugs. We conclude that 
single-gene markers are only able to identify those drug-sensitive cell lines 
with the considered actionable mutation, unlike multi-gene markers that can in 
principle combine multiple gene mutations to identify additional sensitive cell 
lines. We also found that cell line sensitivities to some drugs (e.g. 
Temsirolimus, 17-AAG or Methotrexate) are better predicted by these 
machine-learning models.

Precision Cancer Medicine: Tumors are classified into several molecular subtypes 
by Genomic Sequencing. Comprehensive targeted-gene panel provides more 
therapeutic options. CANCERPLEX-JP version 4.0 includes 435 actionable genes, 
which clinical approaches are available. Utilizing the gene panel platform, we 
assessed the genes and pathways most frequently altered in Japanese and US cases 
(Genome Med 2016;8:136). We demonstrate concordance of CANCERPLEX-JP with 
whole-exome sequencing from the TCGA in identifying hypermutated samples and 
microsatellite instability in multiple cancer types, such as colorectal and 
gastric cancer. We introduced our activity for precision medicine at 4th 
US-Japan Clinical Trials in Oncology Workshop sponsored by Embassy of Japan, at 
Washington DC, held in June 9, 2016. We highlight the clinical utility of 
CANCERPLEX-JP (435 genes) in guiding treatment strategies with targeted therapy 
in solid tumors, thus providing rationale for Comprehensive Genomic Sequencing 
in actualizing precision medicine. The goal of Precision Medicine is cost 
effectiveness and realization of genome drug discovery.Super-computing System: 
This introduction plan is based on the massive medical big data (cancer gene 
mutation information, genomic data, image data, etc.) possessed by Niigata 
Prefecture and Niigata University, to construct an integrated analysis system 
incorporating deep learning, and introduces a high-performance computer system 
for the development and activation of related industries. Therefore, it is 
necessary to have an operation system that can connect to the hospital 
electronic medical record without interference.(Presented at the 1943rd Meeting, 
July 5, 2017).

A major challenge in the care of patients with heart failure and preserved 
ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the lack of proven therapies due to disappointing 
results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The heterogeneity of the HFpEF 
syndrome and the use of conventional RCT designs are possible reasons underlying 
the failure of these trials. There are several factors-including the widespread 
adoption of electronic health records, decreasing costs of obtaining 
high-dimensional data, and the availability of a wide variety of potential 
therapeutics-that have evolved to enable more innovative clinical trial designs 
in HFpEF. Here, we review the current landscape of HFpEF RCTs and present 
several innovative RCT designs that could be implemented in HFpEF, including 
enrichment trials, adaptive trials, umbrella trials, basket trials, and machine 
learning-based trials (including examples for each). Our hope is that the 
description of the aforementioned innovative trial designs will stimulate new 
approaches to clinical trials in HFpEF.

Precision medicine aims to predict a patient's disease risk and best therapeutic 
options by using that individual's genetic sequencing data. The Critical 
Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI) is a community experiment consisting 
of genotype-phenotype prediction challenges; participants build models, undergo 
assessment, and share key findings. For CAGI 4, three challenges involved using 
exome-sequencing data: Crohn's disease, bipolar disorder, and warfarin dosing. 
Previous CAGI challenges included prior versions of the Crohn's disease 
challenge. Here, we discuss the range of techniques used for phenotype 
prediction as well as the methods used for assessing predictive models. 
Additionally, we outline some of the difficulties associated with making 
predictions and evaluating them. The lessons learned from the exome challenges 
can be applied to both research and clinical efforts to improve phenotype 
prediction from genotype. In addition, these challenges serve as a vehicle for 
sharing clinical and research exome data in a secure manner with scientists who 
have a broad range of expertise, contributing to a collaborative effort to 
advance our understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships.

The management of thyroid nodules, one of the main clinical challenges in 
endocrine clinical practice, is usually straightforward. Although the most 
important concern is ruling out malignancy, there are grey areas where 
uncertainty is frequently present: the nodules labelled as indeterminate by 
cytology and the extent of therapy when thyroid cancer is diagnosed 
pathologically. There is evidence that the current available precision medicine 
tools (from all the "-omics" to molecular analysis, fine-tuning imaging or 
artificial intelligence) may help to fill present gaps in the future. We present 
here a commentary on some of the current challenges faced by endocrinologists in 
the field of thyroid nodules and cancer, and illustrate how precision medicine 
may improve their diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities in the future.

There are few proven therapies for heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF). The lack of therapies, along with increased recognition of the 
disorder and its underlying pathophysiology, has led to the acknowledgement that 
HFpEF is heterogeneous and is not likely to respond to a one-size-fits-all 
approach. Thus, HFpEF is a prime candidate to benefit from a precision medicine 
approach. For this reason, we have assembled a compendium of papers on the topic 
of precision medicine in HFpEF in the Journal of Cardiovascular Translational 
Research. These papers cover a variety of topics relevant to precision medicine 
in HFpEF, including automated identification of HFpEF patients; machine 
learning, novel molecular approaches, genomics, and deep phenotyping of HFpEF; 
and clinical trial designs that can be used to advance precision medicine in 
HFpEF. In this introductory article, we provide an overview of precision 
medicine in HFpEF with the hope that the work described here and in the other 
papers in this special theme issue will stimulate investigators and clinicians 
to advance a more targeted approach to HFpEF classification and treatment.

Precision medicine is the application of genotypic and Omics biomarkers to 
determine the most appropriate, outcome-driven therapy for individual patients. 
To determine the best choice of therapy, institutions use significant 
information technology-enabled data from imaging, electronic medical records, 
sensors in the clinic/hospitals, and wearable sensors to determine treatment 
response. With genomic profiling, targets to affect a disease course are 
continuing to be developed. As clonal mutational prevalence continues to be 
understood, information can be communicated to patients to inform them that 
resistance is common, requiring collection of more genetic mutations from 
patients with further biopsies or blood collection.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex disorder that is 
traditionally stratified based on clinical signs and symptoms. Recent imaging 
and molecular biomarker innovations provide unprecedented opportunities for 
improved TBI precision medicine, incorporating patho-anatomical and molecular 
mechanisms. Complete integration of these diverse data for TBI diagnosis and 
patient stratification remains an unmet challenge.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in 
Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Pilot multicenter study enrolled 586 acute 
TBI patients and collected diverse common data elements (TBI-CDEs) across the 
study population, including imaging, genetics, and clinical outcomes. We then 
applied topology-based data-driven discovery to identify natural subgroups of 
patients, based on the TBI-CDEs collected. Our hypothesis was two-fold: 1) A 
machine learning tool known as topological data analysis (TDA) would reveal 
data-driven patterns in patient outcomes to identify candidate biomarkers of 
recovery, and 2) TDA-identified biomarkers would significantly predict patient 
outcome recovery after TBI using more traditional methods of univariate 
statistical tests. TDA algorithms organized and mapped the data of TBI patients 
in multidimensional space, identifying a subset of mild TBI patients with a 
specific multivariate phenotype associated with unfavorable outcome at 3 and 6 
months after injury. Further analyses revealed that this patient subset had high 
rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and enrichment in several 
distinct genetic polymorphisms associated with cellular responses to stress and 
DNA damage (PARP1), and in striatal dopamine processing (ANKK1, COMT, DRD2).
CONCLUSIONS: TDA identified a unique diagnostic subgroup of patients with 
unfavorable outcome after mild TBI that were significantly predicted by the 
presence of specific genetic polymorphisms. Machine learning methods such as TDA 
may provide a robust method for patient stratification and treatment planning 
targeting identified biomarkers in future clinical trials in TBI patients.

Machine learning algorithms that are both interpretable and accurate are 
essential in applications such as medicine where errors can have a dire 
consequence. Unfortunately, there is currently a tradeoff between accuracy and 
interpretability among state-of-the-art methods. Decision trees are 
interpretable and are therefore used extensively throughout medicine for 
stratifying patients. Current decision tree algorithms, however, are 
consistently outperformed in accuracy by other, less-interpretable machine 
learning models, such as ensemble methods. We present MediBoost, a novel 
framework for constructing decision trees that retain interpretability while 
having accuracy similar to ensemble methods, and compare MediBoost's performance 
to that of conventional decision trees and ensemble methods on 13 medical 
classification problems. MediBoost significantly outperformed current decision 
tree algorithms in 11 out of 13 problems, giving accuracy comparable to ensemble 
methods. The resulting trees are of the same type as decision trees used 
throughout clinical practice but have the advantage of improved accuracy. Our 
algorithm thus gives the best of both worlds: it grows a single, highly 
interpretable tree that has the high accuracy of ensemble methods.

Precision medicine and personalized health efforts propose leveraging complex 
molecular, medical and family history, along with other types of personal data 
toward better life. We argue that this ambitious objective will require advanced 
and specialized machine learning solutions. Simply skimming some low-hanging 
results off the data wealth might have limited potential. Instead, we need to 
better understand all parts of the system to define medically relevant causes 
and effects: how do particular sequence variants affect particular proteins and 
pathways? How do these effects, in turn, cause the health or disease-related 
phenotype? Toward this end, deeper understanding will not simply diffuse from 
deeper machine learning, but from more explicit focus on understanding protein 
function, context-specific protein interaction networks, and impact of variation 
on both.

Medical images constitute a source of information essential for disease 
diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. In addition, due to its patient-specific 
nature, imaging information represents a critical component required for 
advancing precision medicine into clinical practice. This manuscript describes 
recently developed technologies for better handling of image information: 
photorealistic visualization of medical images with Cinematic Rendering, 
artificial agents for in-depth image understanding, support for minimally 
invasive procedures, and patient-specific computational models with enhanced 
predictive power. Throughout the manuscript we will analyze the capabilities of 
such technologies and extrapolate on their potential impact to advance the 
quality of medical care, while reducing its cost.

Precision-recall (PR) curves and the areas under them are widely used to 
summarize machine learning results, especially for data sets exhibiting class 
skew. They are often used analogously to ROC curves and the area under ROC 
curves. It is known that PR curves vary as class skew changes. What was not 
recognized before this paper is that there is a region of PR space that is 
completely unachievable, and the size of this region depends only on the skew. 
This paper precisely characterizes the size of that region and discusses its 
implications for empirical evaluation methodology in machine learning.

Lancet: a high precision medication event extraction system for clinical text.

Li Z(1), Liu F, Antieau L, Cao Y, Yu H.

Author information:
(1)College of Health Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
USA.

OBJECTIVE: This paper presents Lancet, a supervised machine-learning system that 
automatically extracts medication events consisting of medication names and 
information pertaining to their prescribed use (dosage, mode, frequency, 
duration and reason) from lists or narrative text in medical discharge 
summaries.
DESIGN: Lancet incorporates three supervised machine-learning models: a 
conditional random fields model for tagging individual medication names and 
associated fields, an AdaBoost model with decision stump algorithm for 
determining which medication names and fields belong to a single medication 
event, and a support vector machines disambiguation model for identifying the 
context style (narrative or list).
MEASUREMENTS: The authors, from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 
participated in the third i2b2 shared-task for challenges in natural language 
processing for clinical data: medication extraction challenge. With the 
performance metrics provided by the i2b2 challenge, the micro F1 
(precision/recall) scores are reported for both the horizontal and vertical 
level.
RESULTS: Among the top 10 teams, Lancet achieved the highest precision at 90.4% 
with an overall F1 score of 76.4% (horizontal system level with exact match), a 
gain of 11.2% and 12%, respectively, compared with the rule-based baseline 
system jMerki. By combining the two systems, the hybrid system further increased 
the F1 score by 3.4% from 76.4% to 79.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: Supervised machine-learning systems with minimal external knowledge 
resources can achieve a high precision with a competitive overall F1 
score.Lancet based on this learning framework does not rely on expensive 
manually curated rules. The system is available online at 
http://code.google.com/p/lancet/.

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in Precision Decomposition (PD) 
of indwelling and surface electromyographic (EMG) signals has led to the recent 
development of systems that can automatically resolve most instances of complex 
superposition among action potentials. The remaining errors have to be corrected 
by a user-interactive editing process. Typically, 25% to 50% of such errors 
involve action-potential aliasing, whereby the action potential of a motor unit 
is incorrectly identified in signal data that actually supports the action 
potential of another motor unit. To drastically reduce this class of errors, we 
have added a new aliasing-rejection mechanism in PD algorithms. Experimental 
results on real EMG signals show that aliasing-related errors of the Precision 
Decomposition technique are thereby reduced by 80% to 90%.

MA 02215, USA. hamid@bu.edu

The precision decomposition technique can accurately identify a significant 
number of action potential trains within intramuscular electromyographic (EMG) 
signals. The original version of this technique (PD I) often requires extensive 
user-interactive editing to improve upon the results from a maximum a-posteriori 
probability receiver (MAPR). We have used the integrated processing and 
understanding of signals methodology from artificial intelligence to formulate 
and implement a new multi-receiver solution that augments MAPR with two other 
receivers to gain greater accuracy. Specifically, each new receiver utilizes an 
interleaving of signal and symbol processing stages to address MAPR inadequacies 
in resolving cases of acute superposition and shape instability among motor unit 
trains. Prior to any user-interactive editing, our multi-receiver system 
achieves a classification accuracy of 85.1%, a significant improvement over the 
66.0% accuracy of PD I on the same database of challenging EMG signals.

Since a large amount of clinical data are being stored electronically, discovery 
of knowledge from such clinical databases is one of the important growing 
research area in medical informatics. For this purpose, we develop KDD-R (a 
system for Knowledge Discovery in Databases using Rough sets), an experimental 
system for knowledge discovery and machine learning research using variable 
precision rough sets (VPRS) model, which is an extension of original rough set 
model. This system works in the following steps. First, it preprocesses 
databases and translates continuous data into discretized ones. Second, KDD-R 
checks dependencies between attributes and reduces spurious data. Third, the 
system computes rules from reduced databases. Finally, fourth, it evaluates 
decision making. For evaluation, this system is applied to a clinical database 
of meningoencephalitis, whose computational results show that several new 
findings are obtained.

The acceleration of large-scale sequencing and the progress in high-throughput 
computational analyses, defined as omics, was a hallmark for the comprehension 
of the biological processes in human health and diseases. In cancerology, the 
omics approach, initiated by genomics and transcriptomics studies, has revealed 
an incredible complexity with unsuspected molecular diversity within a same 
tumor type as well as spatial and temporal heterogeneity of tumors. The 
integration of multiple biological layers of omics studies brought oncology to a 
new paradigm, from tumor site classification to pan-cancer molecular 
classification, offering new therapeutic opportunities for precision medicine. 
In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the latest 
innovations for multi-omics integration in oncology and summarize the largest 
multi-omics dataset available for adult and pediatric cancers. We will present 
multi-omics techniques for characterizing cancer biology and show how 
multi-omics data can be combined with clinical data for the identification of 
prognostic and treatment-specific biomarkers, opening the way to personalized 
therapy. To conclude, we will detail the newest strategies for dissecting the 
tumor immune environment and host-tumor interaction. We will explore the 
advances in immunomics and microbiomics for biomarker identification to guide 
therapeutic decision in immuno-oncology.

Moving toward precision PTSD treatment: predicting veterans' intensive PTSD 
treatment response using continuously updating machine learning models.

Bourbonnais, Illinois 60914, USA.

BACKGROUND: Considerable heterogeneity exists in treatment response to 
first-line posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatments, such as Cognitive 
Processing Therapy (CPT). Relatively little is known about the timing of when 
during a course of care the treatment response becomes apparent. Novel machine 
learning methods, especially continuously updating prediction models, have the 
potential to address these gaps in our understanding of response and optimize 
PTSD treatment.
METHODS: Using data from a 3-week (n = 362) CPT-based intensive PTSD treatment 
program (ITP), we explored three methods for generating continuously updating 
prediction models to predict endpoint PTSD severity. These included Mixed 
Effects Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (MixedBART), Mixed Effects Random 
Forest (MERF) machine learning models, and Linear Mixed Effects models (LMM). 
Models used baseline and self-reported PTSD symptom severity data collected 
every other day during treatment. We then validated our findings by examining 
model performances in a separate, equally established, 2-week CPT-based ITP (n = 
108).
RESULTS: Results across approaches were very similar and indicated modest 
prediction accuracy at baseline (R2 ~ 0.18), with increasing accuracy of 
predictions of final PTSD severity across program timepoints (e.g. mid-program 
R2 ~ 0.62). Similar findings were obtained when the models were applied to the 
2-week ITP. Neither the MERF nor the MixedBART machine learning approach 
outperformed LMM prediction, though benefits of each may differ based on the 
application.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing continuously updating models in PTSD treatments may be 
beneficial for clinicians in determining whether an individual is responding, 
and when this determination can be made.

Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of obesity, the diagnosis and treatment 
of obesity vary greatly. Five to 10 percent of body weight can be lost through 
lifestyle modifications, nutritional and behavioral counseling, and the use of 
approved weight reduction medicines for obesity and diabetes; however, these 
non-surgical treatments are not effective for all patients. Compared to medical 
therapy, bariatric surgery is associated with higher rates of type 2 diabetes 
remission, lower mortality from vascular complications, and long-term, sustained 
weight loss. With the advent of precision medicine in surgical therapy, 
bariatric surgeons' fundamental understanding of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric 
bypass surgery has evolved in recent years. The objective of surgery has shifted 
from short-term weight loss to the safe and successful long-term management of 
patient weight and comorbidities. In laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
surgery, the concept of precision bariatric and metabolic surgery is mainly 
reflected in three aspects: accurate preoperative assessment, precise 
intraoperative operation, and comprehensive postoperative management. A new 
direction for the future development of precision laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric 
bypass surgery and obesity metabolic surgery is to formulate precise and 
individualized surgical treatment plans for patients and to use artificial 
intelligence and big data technology to improve the standardization of 
specialist data.

由于肥胖本身的复杂性和异质性，导致肥胖症的诊疗方法个体化差异较大。通过改变生活方式和饮食结构、采用行为疗法以及使用已经批准的减肥药物治疗肥胖和糖尿病患者，可以实现5%~10%的体质量减轻，但并非所有患者都可以通过这些非手术的治疗手段获益。与药物治疗相比，减重代谢手术有更高的2型糖尿病缓解率和更低的血管并发症病死率并且可以长期持续减轻体质量。近些年来，随着精准医学在外科治疗中的发展，减重外科医生对腹腔镜Roux-en-Y胃旁路手术的核心理念也发生了改变。手术目的从强调短期体质量大幅下降转变为安全有效地长期控制患者的体质量和并发症。在腹腔镜Roux-en-Y胃旁路手术中，精准减重代谢外科理念主要体现在3个方面：术前的精准评估、术中的精细操作和术后的综合管理。为患者制定精准、个体化的手术治疗方案，同时利用人工智能和大数据技术，提高专科数据的标准化是精准腹腔镜Roux-en-Y胃旁路手术和减重代谢外科未来发展的新方向。.

Data augmentation using a generative adversarial network for a high-precision 
instantaneous microwave frequency measurement system.

Jabin MA, Fok MP.

In this Letter, an unsupervised-learning platform-generative adversarial network 
(GAN)-is proposed for experimental data augmentation in a deep-learning assisted 
photonic-based instantaneous microwave frequency measurement (IFM) system. Only 
75 sets of experimental data are required and the GAN can augment the small 
amount of data into 5000 sets of data for training the deep learning model. 
Furthermore, frequency measurement error of the estimated frequency has improved 
by an order of magnitude from 50 MHz to 5 MHz. The proposed use of GAN 
effectively reduces the amount of experimental data needed by 98.75% and reduces 
measurement error by 10 times.

For many oncological conditions, the application of timely and patient-tailored 
targeted therapies, or precision medicine, is a major therapeutic development 
that has provided considerable clinical benefit. However, despite the 
application of increasingly sophisticated technologies, alongside advanced 
bioinformatic and machine-learning algorithms, this success is yet to be 
replicated for the rheumatic diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis, for example, 
despite an array of targeted biologic and conventional therapeutics, treatment 
choice remains largely based on trial and error. The concept of the 'precision 
gap' for rheumatic disease can help us to identify factors that underpin the 
slow progress towards the discovery and adoption of precision-medicine 
approaches for rheumatic disease. In a rheumatic disease such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, it is possible to identify four themes that have slowed progress, 
solutions to which should help to close the precision gap. These themes relate 
to our fundamental understanding of disease pathogenesis, how we determine 
treatment response, confounders of treatment outcomes and trial design.

Developing a classification of hematologic neoplasms in the era of precision 
medicine.

The recently developed International Consensus (IC) classification of 
hematologic neoplasms is primarily based on input from clinical advisory 
committees composed of pathologists, hematologists, oncologists, and genomic 
scientists. Morphology continues to represent a fundamental element in the 
definition of hematologic neoplasms. Acknowledging that the abnormal morphology 
is a result of dysregulated hematopoiesis driven by somatic gene mutations or 
altered expression, the IC classification considers genomic features more 
extensively. Defining nosologic entities based on underlying molecular 
mechanism(s) of disease is fundamental for enabling the development of precision 
treatments. Because translational and clinical research continuously advance the 
field, the classification of hematologic neoplasms will need to be regularly 
refined and updated; the basic question is what mechanism should be used for 
this purpose. Scientific hematopathology societies, in collaboration with 
hematology societies, should be primarily responsible for establishing a 
standing International Working Group, which would in turn collaborate with the 
World Health Organization (WHO)/International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC) to realize and disseminate the classification. The current 
classification, with its strong morphology component, represents a basis for 
refinement. Through data sharing, the creation of large comprehensive patient 
data sets will allow the use of methods of inference, including statistical 
analyses and machine learning models, aimed at further identifying distinct 
disease subgroups. A collaborative clinico-pathologic review process will 
provide a mechanism for updating pathologic and genomic criteria within a 
clinical context. An interactive Web-based portal would make the classification 
more immediately available to the scientific community, while providing 
accessory features that enable the practical application of diagnostic, 
prognostic, and predictive information.

Precision oncology, which ensures optimized cancer treatment tailored to the 
unique biology of a patient's disease, has rapidly developed and is of great 
clinical importance. Deep learning has become the main method for precision 
oncology. This paper summarizes the recent deep-learning approaches relevant to 
precision oncology and reviews over 150 articles within the last six years. 
First, we survey the deep-learning approaches categorized by various precision 
oncology tasks, including the estimation of dose distribution for treatment 
planning, survival analysis and risk estimation after treatment, prediction of 
treatment response, and patient selection for treatment planning. Secondly, we 
provide an overview of the studies per anatomical area, including the brain, 
bladder, breast, bone, cervix, esophagus, gastric, head and neck, kidneys, 
liver, lung, pancreas, pelvis, prostate, and rectum. Finally, we highlight the 
challenges and discuss potential solutions for future research directions.

Digital smile design (DSD) technology, which takes pictures of patients' faces 
together with anterior dentition and uses them for prosthesis design, has been 
recently introduced. However, the limitation of DSD is that it evaluates a 
patient with only one photograph taken in a still state, and the patient's 
profile cannot be observed from various viewpoints. Therefore, this study aims 
to segment the patient's anterior teeth, gingiva and facial landmarks using 
YOLACT++. We trained YOLACT++ on the annotated data of the teeth, lips and 
gingiva from the Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ) data. We evaluated that the model 
trained by 2D candid facial images for the detection and segmentation of smile 
characteristics. The results show the possibility of an automated smile 
characteristic identification system for the automatic and accurate quantitative 
assessment of a patient's smile.

Neonates and children in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) 
contribute to the highest number of sepsis-associated deaths globally. 
Interventions to prevent sepsis mortality are hampered by a lack of 
comprehensive epidemiological data and pathophysiological understanding of 
biological pathways. In this review, we discuss the challenges faced by LMICs in 
diagnosing sepsis in these age groups. We highlight a role for multi-omics and 
health care data to improve diagnostic accuracy of clinical algorithms, arguing 
that health-care systems urgently need precision medicine to avoid the pitfalls 
of missed diagnoses, misdiagnoses, and overdiagnoses, and associated 
antimicrobial resistance. We discuss ethical, regulatory, and systemic barriers 
related to the collection and use of big data in LMICs. Technologies such as 
cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and medical tricorders might help, but 
they require collaboration with local communities. Co-partnering (joint equal 
development of technology between producer and end-users) could facilitate 
integration of these technologies as part of future care-delivery systems, 
offering a chance to transform the global management and prevention of sepsis 
for neonates and children.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes the most prevalent sexually transmitted 
infection (STI) in the United States. Sexually active young adults are 
susceptible to HPV, accounting for approximately 50% of new STIs. Oncogenic HPV 
subtypes 16 and 18 are associated with squamous intraepithelial lesions and 
cancers and are mostly preventable through prophylactic HPV vaccination. 
Accordingly, this study's objectives are to (1) summarize SDoH barriers and 
implication for low HPV vaccination rates among young adults (18-26 years), (2) 
propose a digital health solution that utilizes the PHL to collect, integrate, 
and manage personalized sexual and health information, and (3) describe the 
features of the PHL-based app. Through the application of novel techniques from 
artificial intelligence, specifically knowledge representation, semantic web, 
and natural language processing, this proposed PHL-based application will 
compile clinical, biomedical, and SDoH data from multi-dimensional sources. 
Therefore, this application will provide digital health interventions that are 
customized to individuals' specific needs and capacities. The PHL-based 
application could promote management and usage of personalized digital health 
information to facilitate precision health promotion thereby, informing health 
decision-making regarding HPV vaccinations, routine HPV/STI testing, cancer 
screenings, vaccine safety/efficacy/side effects, and safe sexual practices. In 
addition to detecting vaccine hesitancy, disparities and perceived barriers, 
this application could address participants' specific needs/challenges with 
navigating health literacy, technical skills, peer influence, education, 
language, cultural and spiritual beliefs. Precision health promotion focused on 
improving knowledge acquisition and information-seeking behaviors, promoting 
safe sexual practices, increasing HPV vaccinations, and facilitating cancer 
screenings could be effective in preventing HPV-associated cancers.

Disruptive innovations in the clinical laboratory: catching the wave of 
precision diagnostics.

Disruptive innovation is an invention that disrupts an existing market and 
creates a new one by providing a different set of values, which ultimately 
overtakes the existing market. Typically, when disruptive innovations are 
introduced, their performance is initially less than existing standard 
technologies, but because of their ability to bring the cost down, and with 
gradual improvement, they end up replacing established service 
standards.Disruptive technologies have their fingerprints in health care. 
Pathology and laboratory medicine are fertile soils for disruptive innovations 
because they are heavily reliant on technology. Disruptive innovations have 
resulted in a revolution of our diagnostic ability and will take laboratory 
medicine to the next level of patient care. There are several examples of 
disruptive innovations in the clinical laboratory. Digitizing pathology practice 
is an example of disruptive technology, with many advantages and an extended 
scope of applications. Next-generation sequencing can be disruptive in two ways. 
The first is by replacing an array of laboratory tests, which each requires 
expensive and specialized instruments and expertise, with a single 
cost-effective technology. The second is by disrupting the current paradigm of 
the clinical laboratory as a diagnostic service by taking it into a new era of 
preventive or primary care pathology. Other disruptive innovations include the 
use of dry chemistry reagents in chemistry analyzers and also point of care 
testing. The use of artificial intelligence is another promising disruptive 
innovation that can transform the future of pathology and laboratory medicine. 
Another emerging disruptive concept is the integration of two fields of medicine 
to create an interrelated discipline such as "histogenomics and radiohistomics." 
Another recent disruptive innovation in laboratory medicine is the use of social 
media in clinical practice, education, and publication.There are multiple 
reasons to encourage disruptive innovations in the clinical laboratory, 
including the escalating cost of health care, the need for better accessibility 
of diagnostic care, and the increased demand on the laboratory in the era of 
precision diagnostics. There are, however, a number of challenges that need to 
be overcome such as the significant resistance to disruptive innovations by 
current technology providers and governmental regulatory bodies. The hesitance 
from health care providers and insurance companies must also be 
addressed.Adoption of disruptive innovations requires a multifaceted approach 
that involves orchestrated solutions to key aspects of the process, including 
creating successful business models, multidisciplinary collaborations, and 
innovative accreditation and regulatory oversight. It also must be coupled with 
successful commercialization plans and modernization of health care structure. 
Fostering a culture of disruptive innovation requires establishing unique 
collaborative models between academia and industry. It also requires uncovering 
new sources of unconventional funding that are open to high-risk high-reward 
projects. It should also be matched with innovative thinking, including new 
approaches for delivery of care and identifying novel cohorts of patients who 
can benefit from disruptive technology.

Providing therapies tailored to each patient is the vision of precision 
medicine, enabled by the increasing ability to capture extensive data about 
individual patients. In this position paper, we argue that the second enabling 
pillar towards this vision is the increasing power of computers and algorithms 
to learn, reason, and build the 'digital twin' of a patient. Computational 
models are boosting the capacity to draw diagnosis and prognosis, and future 
treatments will be tailored not only to current health status and data, but also 
to an accurate projection of the pathways to restore health by model 
predictions. The early steps of the digital twin in the area of cardiovascular 
medicine are reviewed in this article, together with a discussion of the 
challenges and opportunities ahead. We emphasize the synergies between 
mechanistic and statistical models in accelerating cardiovascular research and 
enabling the vision of precision medicine.

AIMS: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have become a successful treatment in 
metastatic melanoma. The high response rates in a subset of patients suggest 
that a sensitive companion diagnostic test is required. The predictive value of 
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) staining in melanoma has been questioned due 
to inconsistent correlation with clinical outcome. Whether this is due to 
predictive irrelevance of PD-L1 expression or inaccurate assessment techniques 
remains unclear. The aim of this study was to develop a standardised digital 
protocol for the assessment of PD-L1 staining in melanoma and to compare the 
output data and reproducibility to conventional assessment by expert 
pathologists.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In two cohorts with a total of 69 cutaneous melanomas, a 
highly significant correlation was found between pathologist-based consensus 
reading and automated PD-L1 analysis (r = 0.97, P < 0.0001). Digital scoring 
captured the full diagnostic spectrum of PD-L1 expression at single cell 
resolution. An average of 150 472 melanoma cells (median 38 668 cells; 
range = 733-1 078 965) were scored per lesion. Machine learning was used to 
control for heterogeneity introduced by PD-L1-positive inflammatory cells in the 
tumour microenvironment. The PD-L1 image analysis protocol showed excellent 
reproducibility (r = 1.0, P < 0.0001) when carried out on independent 
workstations and reduced variability in PD-L1 scoring of human observers. When 
melanomas were grouped by PD-L1 expression status, we found a clear correlation 
of PD-L1 positivity with CD8-positive T cell infiltration, but not with tumour 
stage, metastasis or driver mutation status.
CONCLUSION: Digital evaluation of PD-L1 reduces scoring variability and may 
facilitate patient stratification in clinical practice.

MOTIVATION: In genome-wide rate comparison studies, there is a big challenge for 
effective identification of an appropriate number of significant features 
objectively, since traditional statistical comparisons without multi-testing 
correction can generate a large number of false positives while multi-testing 
correction tremendously decreases the statistic power.
RESULTS: In this study, we proposed a new exact test based on the translation of 
rate comparison to two binomial distributions. With modeling and real datasets, 
the exact binomial test (EBT) showed an advantage in balancing the statistical 
precision and power, by providing an appropriate size of significant features 
for further studies. Both correlation analysis and bootstrapping tests 
demonstrated that EBT is as robust as the typical rate-comparison methods, e.g. 
χ 2 test, Fisher's exact test and Binomial test. Performance comparison among 
machine learning models with features identified by different statistical tests 
further demonstrated the advantage of EBT. The new test was also applied to 
analyze the genome-wide somatic gene mutation rate difference between lung 
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), two main lung 
cancer subtypes and a list of new markers were identified that could be 
lineage-specifically associated with carcinogenesis of LUAD and LUSC, 
respectively. Interestingly, three cilia genes were found selectively with high 
mutation rates in LUSC, possibly implying the importance of cilia dysfunction in 
the carcinogenesis.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer an ideal platform to study the strain 
fields induced by individual atomic defects, yet challenges associated with 
radiation damage have so far limited electron microscopy methods to probe these 
atomic-scale strain fields. Here, we demonstrate an approach to probe 
single-atom defects with sub-picometer precision in a monolayer 2D transition 
metal dichalcogenide, WSe2-2xTe2x. We utilize deep learning to mine large data 
sets of aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy images to 
locate and classify point defects. By combining hundreds of images of nominally 
identical defects, we generate high signal-to-noise class averages which allow 
us to measure 2D atomic spacings with up to 0.2 pm precision. Our methods reveal

Despite the tremendous success, pitfalls have been observed in every step of a 
clinical metabolomics workflow, which impedes the internal validity of the 
study. Furthermore, the demand for logistics, instrumentations, and 
computational resources for metabolic phenotyping studies has far exceeded our 
expectations. In this conceptual review, we will cover inclusive barriers of a 
metabolomics-based clinical study and suggest potential solutions in the hope of 
enhancing study robustness, usability, and transferability. The importance of 
quality assurance and quality control procedures is discussed, followed by a 
practical rule containing five phases, including two additional "pre-pre-" and 
"post-post-" analytical steps. Besides, we will elucidate the potential 
involvement of machine learning and demonstrate that the need for automated data 
mining algorithms to improve the quality of future research is undeniable. 
Consequently, we propose a comprehensive metabolomics framework, along with an 
appropriate checklist refined from current guidelines and our previously 
published assessment, in the attempt to accurately translate achievements in 
metabolomics into clinical and epidemiological research. Furthermore, the 
integration of multifaceted multi-omics approaches with metabolomics as the 
pillar member is in urgent need. When combining with other social or nutritional 
factors, we can gather complete omics profiles for a particular disease. Our 
discussion reflects the current obstacles and potential solutions toward the 
progressing trend of utilizing metabolomics in clinical research to create the 
next-generation healthcare system.

Heart failure (HF) is one of the most complex chronic disorders with high 
prevalence, mainly due to the ageing population and better treatment of 
underlying diseases. Prevalence will continue to rise and is estimated to reach 
3% of the population in Western countries by 2025. It is the most important 
cause of hospitalisation in subjects aged 65 years or more, resulting in high 
costs and major social impact. The current "one-size-fits-all" approach in the 
treatment of HF does not result in best outcome for all patients. These facts 
are an imminent threat to good quality management of patients with HF. An 
unorthodox approach from a new vision on care is required. We propose a novel 
predictive, preventive and personalised medicine approach where patients are 
truly leading their management, supported by an easily accessible online 
application that takes advantage of artificial intelligence. This strategy paper 
describes the needs in HF care, the needed paradigm shift and the elements that 
are required to achieve this shift. Through the inspiring collaboration of 
clinical and high-tech partners from North-West Europe combining state of the 
art HF care, artificial intelligence, serious gaming and patient coaching, a 
virtual doctor is being created. The results are expected to advance and 
personalise self-care, where standard care tasks are performed by the patients 
themselves, in principle without involvement of healthcare professionals, the 
latter being able to focus on complex conditions. This new vision on care will 
significantly reduce costs per patient while improving outcomes to enable 
long-term sustainability of top-level HF care.

OBJECTIVE: There is growing interest in the development of composite precision 
treatment rules (PTRs) to guide the selection of the treatments most likely to 
be helpful for individual patients. We present here the results of an effort to 
develop a preliminary PTR for Collaborative Assessment and Management of 
Suicidality (CAMS) relative to enhanced-care as usual based on secondary 
analysis of the Operation Worth Living (OWL) randomized controlled trial. The 
outcome of interest is eliminating suicide ideation (SI) within 3 months of 
initiating treatment.
METHOD: A state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning method was used to develop 
the PTR among the n = 148 U.S. Soldiers (predominately male and White, age range 
18-48) OWL patients.
RESULTS: We estimated that CAMS was the better treatment for 77.8% of patients 
and that treatment assignment according to the PTR would result in a 13.6% (95% 
CI: 0.9%-26.3%) increase in 3-month SI remission compared to random treatment 
assignment.
CONCLUSIONS: Although promising, results are limited by the small sample size, 
restrictive baseline assessment, and inability to evaluate effects on suicidal 
behaviors or disaggregate based on history of suicidal behaviors. Replication is 
needed in larger samples with comprehensive baseline assessments, longer-term 
follow-ups, and more extensive outcomes.

In evidence-based mental health practice, decisions must often be made for which 
there is little or no empirical basis. A common example of this is when there 
are multiple empirically supported interventions for a person with a given 
diagnosis, where the aim is to recommend the treatment most likely to be 
effective for that person. Data obtained from randomized clinical trials allow 
for the identification of patient characteristics that could be used to match 
patients to treatments. Historically, researchers have focused on individual 
moderators, single variables that interact statistically with treatment type, 
but these have rarely proved powerful enough to inform treatment decisions. 
Recently, researchers have begun to explore ways in which the use of 
multivariable algorithms might improve clinical decision-making. Common pitfalls 
have been identified, including the use of methods that provide overoptimistic 
estimates of the gains that can be expected from the applications of an 
algorithm in a clinical setting. It is too early to tell if these efforts will 
pay off and, if so, how much their use can increase the efficiency and 
effectiveness of mental health systems. It behooves the field to continue to 
learn and develop the most powerful methods that can produce generalizable 
knowledge that will advance the aims of precision mental health.

Most machine learning algorithms involve many multiply-accumulate operations, 
which dictate the computation time and energy required. Vector-matrix 
multiplications can be accelerated using resistive networks, which can be 
naturally implemented in a crossbar geometry by leveraging Kirchhoff's current 
law in a single readout step. However, practical computing tasks that require 
high precision are still very challenging to implement in a resistive crossbar 
array owing to intrinsic device variability and unavoidable crosstalk, such as 
sneak path currents through adjacent devices, which inherently result in low 
precision. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a precision-extension technique 
for a carbon nanotube (CNT) transistor crossbar array. High precision is 
attained through multiple devices operating together, each of which stores a 
portion of the required bit width. A 10 × 10 CNT transistor array can perform 
vector-matrix multiplication with high accuracy, making in-memory computing 
approaches attractive for high-performance computing environments.

The benefit of regular physical activity and exercise training for the 
prevention of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is undisputed. Many 
molecular mechanisms mediating exercise effects have been deciphered. 
Personalised exercise prescription can help patients in achieving their 
individual greatest benefit from an exercise-based cardiovascular rehabilitation 
programme. Yet, we still struggle to provide truly personalised exercise 
prescriptions to our patients. In this position paper, we address novel basic 
and translational research concepts that can help us understand the principles 
underlying the inter-individual differences in the response to exercise, and 
identify early on who would most likely benefit from which exercise 
intervention. This includes hereditary, non-hereditary and sex-specific 
concepts. Recent insights have helped us to take on a more holistic view, 
integrating exercise-mediated molecular mechanisms with those influenced by 
metabolism and immunity. Unfortunately, while the outline is recognisable, many 
details are still lacking to turn the understanding of a concept into a roadmap 
ready to be used in clinical routine. This position paper therefore also 
investigates perspectives on how the advent of 'big data' and the use of animal 
models could help unravel inter-individual responses to exercise parameters and 
thus influence hypothesis-building for translational research in exercise-based 
cardiovascular rehabilitation.

Liver resection remains the best curative option for primary liver cancer, such 
as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In 
particular, in liver resection for HCC, anatomical resection of the 
tumor-bearing segments is highly recommended to eradicate the intrahepatic 
metastases spreading through portal venous branches. Anatomical liver resection, 
including anatomical segmentectomy and subsegmentectomy using the dye-injection 
method, is technically demanding and requires experience for completion of a 
precise procedure. The recent development of imaging studies and new computer 
technologies has allowed for the preoperative design of the operative procedure, 
intraoperative navigation, and postoperative quality evaluation of the 
anatomical liver resection. Although these new technologies are related to the 
progress of artificial intelligence, the actual operative procedure is still 
performed as human-hand work. A precise anatomical liver resection still 
requires meticulous exposure of the boundary of hepatic venous tributaries with 
deep knowledge of liver anatomy and utilization of intraoperative 
ultrasonography.

In the latest World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms, 
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) exists as a separate entity under the 
category of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative (MDS/MPN) overlap syndromes. 
Outcomes remain uniformly poor with a median overall survival of ~2 years and an 
inherent risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (15-20% over 5 
years). Due to unique biologic characteristics such as overlapping features of 
myelodysplasia and myeloproliferation, and clinical diversity despite relative 
genomic homogeneity, CMML represents a unique model to study chronic myeloid 
tumor biology. Recent advances have focused on understanding the role of 
putative genomic abnormalities, in particular, clonal evolution of pathogenic 
alterations in genes regulating the epigenome (TET2), chromatin architecture 
(ASXL1), spliceosome complex (SRSF2, SF3B1) and cell signaling (NRAS, KRAS, CBL, 
JAK2). Disease prognostication has evolved from purely clinical prognostic 
models to those incorporating pathogenic gene variations. Therapeutic options in 
this disease remain dismal with only two agents approved by the United States 
Food and Drug Administration, namely 5-azacitidine and decitabine. Allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the sole curative option in this 
disease; however is associated with substantial treatment-related morbidity and 
mortality. Future areas of research include opportunities to further improve 
disease prognostication by employing novel technologies such as machine 
learning, incorporation of methylation and cytokine signatures, in addition to 
gene mutations; insights into clonal origins of this disease, and novel 
therapeutic strategies.

Despite advances in translating conventional research into multi-modal treatment 
for colorectal cancer (CRC), therapeutic resistance and relapse remain 
unresolved in advanced resectable and, particularly, non-resectable disease. 
Genome and transcriptome sequencing and editing technologies, coupled with 
interaction mapping and machine learning, are transforming biomedical research, 
representing the most rational hope to overcome unmet research and clinical 
challenges. Rapid progress in both bulk and single-cell next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) analyses in the identification of primary and metastatic 
intratumor genomic and transcriptional heterogeneity (ITH) and the detection of 
circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) alterations is providing critical insight into 
the origins and spatiotemporal evolution of genomic clones responsible for early 
and late therapeutic resistance and relapse. Moreover, DNA and RNA editing pave 
new avenues towards the discovery of novel drug targets. Breakthrough 
combinations of sequencing and editing systems with technologies exploring 
dynamic interaction networks within pioneering studies could delineate how 
coding and non-coding mutations perturb regulatory networks and gene expression. 
This review discusses latest data on genomic and transcriptomic landscapes in 
time and space, as well as early-phase clinical trials on targeted drug 
combinations, highlighting the transition from research to clinical Colorectal 
Cancer Precision Medicine, through non-invasive screening, individualized drug 
response prediction and development of multiple novel drugs. Future studies 
exploring the potential to target key transcriptional drivers and regulators 
will contribute to the next-generation pharmaceutical controllability of 
multi-layered aberrant transcriptional biocircuits.

BACKGROUND: Personalized diet requires matching human genotypic and phenotypic 
features to foods that increase the chance of achieving a desired physiological 
health outcome. New insights and technologies will help to decipher the 
intricacies of diet-health relationships and create opportunities for 
breakthroughs in dietary interventions for personal health management.
SCOPE AND APPROACH: This article describes the scientific progress towards 
personalized diet and points out the need for integrating high-quality data on 
food. A framework for molecular annotation of food is presented, focusing on 
what aspects should be measured and how these measures relate to health. 
Strategies of applying trending technologies to improve personalized diet and 
health are discussed, highlighting challenges and opportunities for transforming 
data into insights and actions.
KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: The goal of personalized diet is to enable 
individuals and caregivers to make informed dietary decisions for targeted 
health management. Achieving this goal requires a better understanding of how 
molecular properties of food influence individual eating behavior and health 
outcomes. Annotating food at a molecular level encompasses characterizing its 
chemical composition and modifications, physicochemical structure, and 
biological properties. Features of molecular properties in the food annotation 
framework are applicable to varied conditions and processes from raw materials 
to meals. Applications of trending technologies, such as omics techniques, 
wearable biosensors, and artificial intelligence, will support data collection, 
data analytics, and personalized dietary actions for targeted health management.

BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and treatment decisions in cancer increasingly depend on a 
detailed analysis of the mutational status of a patient's genome. This analysis 
relies on previously published information regarding the association of 
variations to disease progression and possible interventions. Clinicians to a 
large degree use biomedical search engines to obtain such information; however, 
the vast majority of scientific publications focus on basic science and have no 
direct clinical impact. We develop the Variant-Information Search Tool (VIST), a 
search engine designed for the targeted search of clinically relevant 
publications given an oncological mutation profile.
RESULTS: VIST indexes all PubMed abstracts and content from ClinicalTrials.gov. 
It applies advanced text mining to identify mentions of genes, variants and 
drugs and uses machine learning based scoring to judge the clinical relevance of 
indexed abstracts. Its functionality is available through a fast and intuitive 
web interface. We perform several evaluations, showing that VIST's ranking is 
superior to that of PubMed or a pure vector space model with regard to the 
clinical relevance of a document's content.
CONCLUSION: Different user groups search repositories of scientific publications 
with different intentions. This diversity is not adequately reflected in the 
standard search engines, often leading to poor performance in specialized 
settings. We develop a search engine for the specific case of finding documents 
that are clinically relevant in the course of cancer treatment. We believe that 
the architecture of our engine, heavily relying on machine learning algorithms, 
can also act as a blueprint for search engines in other, equally specific 
domains. VIST is freely available at https://vist.informatik.hu-berlin.de/.

In the era of personalized medicine, the emphasis of health care is shifting 
from populations to individuals. Artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of 
learning without explicit instruction and has emerging applications in medicine, 
particularly radiology. Whereas much attention has focused on teaching radiology 
trainees about AI, here our goal is to instead focus on how AI might be 
developed to better teach radiology trainees. While the idea of using AI to 
improve education is not new, the application of AI to medical and radiological 
education remains very limited. Based on the current educational foundation, we 
highlight an AI-integrated framework to augment radiology education and provide 
use case examples informed by our own institution's practice. The coming age of 
"AI-augmented radiology" may enable not only "precision medicine" but also what 
we describe as "precision medical education," where instruction is tailored to 
individual trainees based on their learning styles and needs.

Pancreas cancer is an aggressive and fatal disease that will become one of the 
leading causes of cancer mortality by 2030. An all-out effort is underway to 
better understand the basic biologic mechanisms of this disease ranging from 
early development to metastatic disease. In order to change the course of this 
disease, diagnostic radiology imaging may play a vital role in providing a 
precise, noninvasive method for early diagnosis and assessment of treatment 
response. Recent progress in combining medical imaging, advanced image analysis 
and artificial intelligence, termed radiomics, can offer an innovate approach in 
detecting the earliest changes of tumor development as well as a rapid method 
for the detection of response. In this chapter, we introduce the principles of 
radiomics and demonstrate how it can provide additional information into tumor 
biology, early detection, and response assessments advancing the goals of 
precision imaging to deliver the right treatment to the right person at the 
right time.

BACKGROUND: Modern genomic and proteomic profiling methods produce large amounts 
of data from tissue and blood-based samples that are of potential utility for 
improving patient care. However, the design of precision medicine tests for 
unmet clinical needs from this information in the small cohorts available for 
test discovery remains a challenging task. Obtaining reliable performance 
assessments at the earliest stages of test development can also be problematic. 
We describe a novel approach to classifier development designed to create 
clinically useful tests together with reliable estimates of their performance. 
The method incorporates elements of traditional and modern machine learning to 
facilitate the use of cohorts where the number of samples is less than the 
number of measured patient attributes. It is based on a hierarchy of 
classification and information abstraction and combines boosting, bagging, and 
strong dropout regularization.
RESULTS: We apply this dropout-regularized combination approach to two clinical 
problems in oncology using mRNA expression and associated clinical data and 
compare performance with other methods of classifier generation, including 
Random Forest. Performance of the new method is similar to or better than the 
Random Forest in the two classification tasks used for comparison. The 
dropout-regularized combination method also generates an effective classifier in 
a classification task with a known confounding variable. Most importantly, it 
provides a reliable estimate of test performance from a relatively small 
development set of samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The flexible dropout-regularized combination approach is able to 
produce tests tailored to particular clinical questions and mitigate known 
confounding effects. It allows the design of molecular diagnostic tests 
addressing particular clinical questions together with reliable assessment of 
whether test performance is likely to be fit-for-purpose in independent 
validation at the earliest stages of development.

Precision medicine has a long history dating to the early 20th century when 
inquiries into the biochemical basis of large person-to-person variations in 
susceptibility to human diseases and response to medicines had first begun. Yet, 
personalized medicine in the 21st century is far from being "future-proof." 
Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and changing human values 
and preferences, call for anticipatory, rather than reactive, approaches to the 
governance of precision medicine futures. In this context, anticipatory 
governance is an innovative approach to understanding technology and innovation 
futures. Anticipatory governance and its corollary anticipatory ethics on 
emerging technologies require interdisciplinary collaboration and communication 
to cultivate shared language, imagination, and orientation toward plausible 
sociotechnical innovation trajectories. This study reports, for the first time 
in the literature to the best of our knowledge, an anticipatory governance 
experiment on "implementation precision medicine (IPM)" using scenario analysis 
and design fiction. Participants were undergraduate students and experts who 
collaboratively imagined the plausible futures of precision medicine. Given the 
long history of the precision medicine field, and recent calls for translating 
big data to real-life clinical applications, implementation was chosen as a key 
focus area of precision medicine futures. We report here several plausible 
future innovation scenarios of interest to precision medicine scientists and 
engineers and researchers in the fields of emerging technology governance, 
responsible innovation, and social studies of science. Of importance, we found 
that the playful quality of the design fiction methodology and the pedagogical 
orientation facilitated by undergraduate student involvement created an engaging 
creative safe space to build transdisciplinary dialog examining the social and 
anticipatory ethics dimensions of IPM. Demonstrating the possibilities of such 
cross-disciplinary dialog and differential expertise, this article is 
conceptualized and coauthored by all participants further attesting to the 
importance of co-designing and co-imagining innovation futures in IPM.

Omics technologies promised improved biomarker discovery for precision medicine. 
The foremost problem of discovered biomarkers is irreproducibility between 
patient cohorts. From a data analytics perspective, the main reason for these 
failures is bias in statistical approaches and overfitting resulting from batch 
effects and confounding factors. The keys to reproducible biomarker discovery 
are: proper study design, unbiased data preprocessing and quality control 
analyses, and a knowledgeable application of statistics and machine learning 
algorithms. In this review, we discuss study design and analysis considerations 
and suggest standards from an expert point-of-view to promote unbiased 
decision-making in biomarker discovery in precision medicine.

In this letter, we propose an indoor visible light positioning technique using a 
Modified Momentum Back-Propagation (MMBP) algorithm based on received signal 
strength (RSS) with sparse training data set. Unlike other neural network 
algorithms that require a large number of training data points to locate 
accurately, we have realized high-precision positioning for 100 test points with 
only 20 training points in a 1.8 m × 1.8 m × 2.1 m localization area. In order 
to verify the adaptability of the MMBP algorithm, we experimentally demonstrate 
two different training data acquisition methods adopting either even or 
arbitrary training sets. In addition, we also demonstrate the positioning 
accuracy of the traditional RSS algorithm. Experimental results show that the 
average localization accuracy optimized by our proposed algorithm is only 1.88 
cm for the arbitrary set and 1.99 cm for the even set, while the average 
positioning error of the traditional RSS algorithm reaches 14.34 cm. Comparison 
indicates that the positioning accuracy of our proposed algorithm is 7.6 times 
higher. Results also show that the performance of our system is higher than some 
previous reports based on RSS and RSS fingerprint databases using complex 
machine learning algorithms trained by a large amount of training points.

The advancement of cancer genomics research due to the development of next 
generation sequencing technologies is going to bring the promise of cancer 
precision medicine, in turn revolutionizing cancer detection and treatment. In 
this review, we will discuss the possible road map for implementation of cancer 
precision medicine into the clinical practice by mainly focusing on the role of 
liquid biopsy, particularly circulating tumor DNA, as a potential tool for 
cancer screening, selection of an appropriate drug(s), surveillance of minimal 
residual diseases, and early detection of recurrence. We will also review the 
current status of genome-driven oncology and emerging field of immunotherapies 
that could be provided to patients to improve their clinical outcome and quality 
of life. Lastly, we will discuss the usefulness of artificial intelligence that 
facilitate complex data integration in our health care/medical care system.

In the past decade, precision genomics based medicine has emerged to provide 
tailored and effective healthcare for patients depending upon their genetic 
features. Genome Wide Association Studies have also identified population based 
risk genetic variants for common and complex diseases. In order to meet the full 
promise of precision medicine, research is attempting to leverage our increasing 
genomic understanding and further develop personalized medical healthcare 
through ever more accurate disease risk prediction models. Polygenic risk 
scoring and machine learning are two primary approaches for disease risk 
prediction. Despite recent improvements, the results of polygenic risk scoring 
remain limited due to the approaches that are currently used. By contrast, 
machine learning algorithms have increased predictive abilities for complex 
disease risk. This increase in predictive abilities results from the ability of 
machine learning algorithms to handle multi-dimensional data. Here, we provide 
an overview of polygenic risk scoring and machine learning in complex disease 
risk prediction. We highlight recent machine learning application developments 
and describe how machine learning approaches can lead to improved complex 
disease prediction, which will help to incorporate genetic features into future 
personalized healthcare. Finally, we discuss how the future application of 
machine learning prediction models might help manage complex disease by 
providing tissue-specific targets for customized, preventive interventions.

DNA methylation profiling has proven to be a powerful analytical tool, which can 
accurately identify the tissue of origin of a wide range of benign and malignant 
neoplasms. Using microarray-based profiling and supervised machine learning 
algorithms, we and other groups have recently unraveled DNA methylation 
signatures capable of aiding the histomolecular diagnosis of different tumor 
types. We have explored the methylomes of metastatic brain tumors from patients 
with lung cancer, breast cancer, and cutaneous melanoma and primary brain 
neoplasms to build epigenetic classifiers. Our brain metastasis methylation 
(BrainMETH) classifier has the ability to determine the type of brain tumor, the 
origin of the metastases, and the clinical-therapeutic subtype for patients with 
breast cancer brain metastases. To facilitate the translation of these 
epigenetic classifiers into clinical practice, we selected and validated the 
most informative genomic regions utilizing quantitative methylation-specific 
polymerase chain reaction (qMSP). We believe that the refinement, expansion, 
integration, and clinical validation of BrainMETH and other recently developed 
epigenetic classifiers will significantly contribute to the development of more 
comprehensive and accurate systems for the personalized management of patients 
with brain metastases.

Imaging has an essential role in the planning and delivery of radiotherapy. 
Recent advances in imaging have led to the development of advanced radiotherapy 
techniques-including image-guided radiotherapy, intensity-modulated 
radiotherapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy and proton beam therapy. The 
optimal use of imaging might enable higher doses of radiation to be delivered to 
the tumour, while sparing normal surrounding tissues. In this article, we review 
how the integration of existing and novel forms of computed tomography, magnetic 
resonance imaging and positron emission tomography have transformed tumour 
delineation in the radiotherapy planning process, and how these advances have 
the potential to allow a more individualised approach to the cancer therapy. 
Recent data suggest that imaging biomarkers that assess underlying tumour 
heterogeneity can identify areas within a tumour that are at higher risk of 
radio-resistance, and therefore potentially allow for biologically focussed dose 
escalation. The rapidly evolving concept of adaptive radiotherapy, including 
artificial intelligence, requires imaging during treatment to be used to modify 
radiotherapy on a daily basis. These advances have the potential to improve 
clinical outcomes and reduce radiation-related long-term toxicities. We outline 
how recent technological advances in both imaging and radiotherapy delivery can 
be combined to shape the future of precision radiation oncology.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is estimated in nearly one quarter of the 
world's population, and of those immunocompetent and infected ~10% will proceed 
to active tuberculosis (TB). Current diagnostics cannot definitively identify 
LTBI and provide no insight into reactivation risk, thereby defining an unmet 
diagnostic challenge of incredible global significance. We introduce a new 
machine-learning-driven approach to LTBI diagnostics that leverages a high 
throughput, multiplexed cytokine detection technology and powerful 
bioinformatics to reveal multi-marker signatures for LTBI diagnosis and risk 
stratification. This approach is enabled through an individualized normalization 
procedure that allows disease-relevant biomarker signatures to be revealed 
despite heterogeneity in basal immune response. Specifically, cytokines secreted 
from antigen-challenged peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected using 
silicon photonic sensor arrays and multidimensional data correlation of 
individually-normalized immune responses revealed signatures important for LTBI 
status. These results demonstrate a powerful combination of multiplexed 
biomarker detection technologies, precision immune normalization, and feature 
selection algorithms that revealed positively correlated multi-biomarker 
signatures for LTBI status and reactivation risk stratification from a 
relatively simple blood-based assay.

Traditionally, precision medicine involves classifying patients to identify 
subpopulations that respond favorably to specific therapeutics. We pose 
precision medicine as a dynamic feedback control problem, where treatment 
administered to a patient is guided by measurements taken during the course of 
treatment. We consider sepsis, a life-threatening condition in which 
dysregulation of the immune system causes tissue damage. We leverage an existing 
simulation of the innate immune response to infection and apply deep 
reinforcement learning (DRL) to discover an adaptive personalized treatment 
policy that specifies effective multicytokine therapy to simulated sepsis 
patients based on systemic measurements. The learned policy achieves a dramatic 
reduction in mortality rate over a set of 500 simulated patients relative to 
standalone antibiotic therapy. Advantages of our approach are threefold: (1) the 
use of simulation allows exploring therapeutic strategies beyond clinical 
practice and available data, (2) advances in DRL accommodate learning complex 
therapeutic strategies for complex biological systems, and (3) optimized 
treatments respond to a patient's individual disease progression over time, 
therefore, capturing both differences across patients and the inherent 
randomness of disease progression within a single patient. We hope that this 
work motivates both considering adaptive personalized multicytokine mediation 
therapy for sepsis and exploiting simulation with DRL for precision medicine 
more broadly.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex multifactorial inflammatory skin disease 
that affects ~280 million people worldwide. About 85% of AD cases begin in 
childhood, a significant portion of which can persist into adulthood. Moreover, 
a typical progression of children with AD to food allergy, asthma or allergic 
rhinitis has been reported ("allergic march" or "atopic march"). AD comprises 
highly heterogeneous sub-phenotypes/endotypes resulting from complex interplay 
between intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as environmental stimuli, and 
genetic factors regulating cutaneous functions (impaired barrier function, 
epidermal lipid, and protease abnormalities), immune functions and the 
microbiome. Though the roles of high-throughput "omics" integrations in defining 
endotypes are recognized, current analyses are primarily based on individual 
omics data and using binary clinical outcomes. Although individual omics 
analysis, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), can effectively map 
variants correlated with AD, the majority of the heritability and the functional 
relevance of discovered variants are not explained or known by the identified 
variants. The limited success of singular approaches underscores the need for 
holistic and integrated approaches to investigate complex phenotypes using 
trans-omics data integration strategies. Integrating omics layers (e.g., genome, 
epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, lipidome, exposome, microbiome), 
which often have complementary and synergistic effects, might provide the 
opportunity to capture the flow of information underlying AD disease 
manifestation. Overlapping genes/candidates derived from multiple omics types 
include FLG, SPINK5, S100A8, and SERPINB3 in AD pathogenesis. Overlapping 
pathways include macrophage, endothelial cell and fibroblast activation 
pathways, in addition to well-known Th1/Th2 and NFkB activation pathways. 
Interestingly, there was more multi-omics overlap at the pathway level than gene 
level. Further analysis of multi-omics overlap at the tissue level showed that 
among 30 tissue types from the GTEx database, skin and esophagus were 
significantly enriched, indicating the biological interconnection between AD and 
food allergy. The present work explores multi-omics integration and provides new 
biological insights to better define the biological basis of AD etiology and 
confirm previously reported AD genes/pathways. In this context, we also discuss 
opportunities and challenges introduced by "big omics data" and their 
integration.

TDS is modeled for an aquifer near an unlined landfill in Canada. Canadian 
Drinking Water Guidelines and other indices are used to evaluate TDS 
concentrations in 27 monitoring wells surrounding the landfill. This study aims 
to predict TDS concentrations using three different modeling approaches: 
dual-step multiple linear regression (MLR), hybrid principal component 
regression (PCR), and backpropagation neural networks (BPNN). An analysis of the 
bias and precision of each models follows, using performance evaluation metrics 
and statistical indices. TDS is one of the most important parameters in 
assessing suitability of water for irrigation, and for overall groundwater 
quality assessment. Good agreement was observed between the MLR1 model and field 
data, although multicollinearity issues exist. Percentage errors of hybrid PCR 
were comparable to the dual-step MLR method. Percentage error for hybrid PCR was 
found to be inversely proportional to TDS concentrations, which was not observed 
for dual-step MLR. Larger errors were obtained from the BPNN models, and higher 
percentage errors were observed in monitoring wells with lower TDS 
concentrations. All models in this study adequately describe the data in testing 
stage (R2 > 0.86). Generally, the dual-step MLR and hybrid PCR models fared 
better (R2avg = 0.981 and 0.974, respectively), while BPNN models performed 
worse (R2avg = 0.904). For this dataset, both regression and machine learning 
models are more suited to predict mid-range data compared to extreme values. 
Advanced regression methods (hybrid PCR and dual-step MLR) are more advantageous 
compared to BPNN.

In-depth modeling of the complex interplay among multiple omics data measured 
from cancer cell lines or patient tumors is providing new opportunities toward 
identification of tailored therapies for individual cancer patients. Supervised 
machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to the omics profiles 
as they enable integrative analyses among the high-dimensional data sets, as 
well as personalized predictions of therapy responses using multi-omics panels 
of response-predictive biomarkers identified through feature selection and 
cross-validation. However, technical variability and frequent missingness in 
input "big data" require the application of dedicated data preprocessing 
pipelines that often lead to some loss of information and compressed view of the 
biological signal. We describe here the state-of-the-art machine learning 
methods for anti-cancer drug response modeling and prediction and give our 
perspective on further opportunities to make better use of high-dimensional 
multi-omics profiles along with knowledge about cancer pathways targeted by 
anti-cancer compounds when predicting their phenotypic responses.

Machine learning can have a major societal impact in computational biology 
applications. In particular, it plays a central role in the development of 
precision medicine, whereby treatment is tailored to the clinical or genetic 
features of the patient. However, these advances require collecting and sharing 
among researchers large amounts of genomic data, which generates much concern 
about privacy. Researchers, study participants and governing bodies should be 
aware of the ways in which the privacy of participants might be compromised, as 
well as of the large body of research on technical solutions to these issues. We 
review how breaches in patient privacy can occur, present recent developments in 
computational data protection and discuss how they can be combined with legal 
and ethical perspectives to provide secure frameworks for genomic data 
sharing.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The growing ubiquity 
of algorithms in society: implications, impacts and innovations'.

Intraoperative imaging (IOI) is performed to guide delineation and localization 
of regions of surgical interest. While oncological surgical planning 
predominantly utilizes x-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), and ultrasound (US), intraoperative guidance mainly remains on 
surgeon interpretation and pathology for confirmation. Over the past decades 
however, intraoperative guidance has evolved significantly with the emergence of 
several novel imaging technologies, including fluorescence-, Raman, 
photoacoustic-, and radio-guided approaches. These modalities have demonstrated 
the potential to further optimize precision in surgical resection and improve 
clinical outcomes for patients. Not only can these technologies enhance our 
understanding of the disease, they can also yield large imaging datasets 
intraoperatively that can be analyzed by deep learning approaches for more rapid 
and accurate pathological diagnosis. Unfortunately, many of these novel 
technologies are still under preclinical or early clinical evaluation. 
Organizations like the Intra-Operative Imaging Study Group of the European 
Society for Molecular Imaging (ESMI) support interdisciplinary interactions with 
the aim to improve technical capabilities in the field, an approach that can 
succeed only if scientists, engineers, and physicians work closely together with 
industry and regulatory bodies to resolve roadblocks to clinical translation. In 
this review, we provide an overview of a variety of novel IOI technologies, 
discuss their challenges, and present future perspectives on the enormous 
potential of IOI for oncological surgical navigation.

As populations continue to age worldwide, the impact of sarcopenia on public 
health will continue to grow. The clinically relevant and increasingly common 
diagnosis of sarcopenia is at the confluence of three tectonic shifts in 
medicine: opportunistic imaging, precision medicine, and machine learning. This 
review focuses on the state-of-the-art imaging of sarcopenia and provides 
context for such imaging by discussing the epidemiology, pathophysiology, 
consequences, and future directions in the field of sarcopenia.

Obesity is a major global public health problem. Understanding how energy 
homeostasis is regulated, and can become dysregulated, is crucial for developing 
new treatments for obesity. Detailed recording of individual behaviour and new 
imaging modalities offer the prospect of medically relevant models of energy 
homeostasis that are both understandable and individually predictive. The 
profusion of data from these sources has led to an interest in applying machine 
learning techniques to gain insight from these large, relatively unstructured 
datasets. We review both physiological models and machine learning results 
across a diverse range of applications in energy homeostasis, and highlight how 
modelling and machine learning can work together to improve predictive ability. 
We collect quantitative details in a comprehensive mathematical supplement. We 
also discuss the prospects of forecasting homeostatic behaviour and stress the 
importance of characterizing stochasticity within and between individuals in 
order to provide practical, tailored forecasts and guidance to combat the spread 
of obesity.

Radiology (imaging) and imaging-guided interventions, which provide 
multi-parametric morphologic and functional information, are playing an 
increasingly significant role in precision medicine. Radiologists are trained to 
understand the imaging phenotypes, transcribe those observations (phenotypes) to 
correlate with underlying diseases and to characterize the images. However, in 
order to understand and characterize the molecular phenotype (to obtain genomic 
information) of solid heterogeneous tumours, the advanced sequencing of those 
tissues using biopsy is required. Thus, radiologists image the tissues from 
various views and angles in order to have the complete image phenotypes, thereby 
acquiring a huge amount of data. Deriving meaningful details from all these 
radiological data becomes challenging and raises the big data issues. Therefore, 
interest in the application of radiomics has been growing in recent years as it 
has the potential to provide significant interpretive and predictive information 
for decision support. Radiomics is a combination of conventional computer-aided 
diagnosis, deep learning methods, and human skills, and thus can be used for 
quantitative characterization of tumour phenotypes. This paper discusses the 
overview of radiomics workflow, the results of various radiomics-based studies 
conducted using various radiological images such as computed tomography (CT), 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron-emission tomography (PET), the 
challenges we are facing, and the potential contribution of radiomics towards 
precision medicine.

Biomarkers are a class of measurable and evaluable indicators with the potential 
to predict disease initiation and progression. In contrast to disease-associated 
factors, biomarkers hold the promise to capture the changeable signatures of 
biological states. With methodological advances, computer-aided biomarker 
discovery has now become a burgeoning paradigm in the field of biomedical 
science. In recent years, the 'big data' term has accumulated for the 
systematical investigation of complex biological phenomena and promoted the 
flourishing of computational methods for systems-level biomarker screening. 
Compared with routine wet-lab experiments, bioinformatics approaches are more 
efficient to decode disease pathogenesis under a holistic framework, which is 
propitious to identify biomarkers ranging from single molecules to molecular 
networks for disease diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. In this review, the 
concept and characteristics of typical biomarker types, e.g. single molecular 
biomarkers, module/network biomarkers, cross-level biomarkers, etc., are 
explicated on the guidance of systems biology. Then, publicly available data 
resources together with some well-constructed biomarker databases and knowledge 
bases are introduced. Biomarker identification models using mathematical, 
network and machine learning theories are sequentially discussed. Based on 
network substructural and functional evidences, a novel bioinformatics model is 
particularly highlighted for microRNA biomarker discovery. This article aims to 
give deep insights into the advantages and challenges of current computational 
approaches for biomarker detection, and to light up the future wisdom toward 
precision medicine and nation-wide healthcare.

The use of collision cross-section (CCS) values derived from ion mobility-mass 
spectrometry (IM-MS) has been proven to facilitate lipid identifications. Its 
utility is restricted by the limited availability of CCS values. Recently, the 
machine-learning algorithm-based prediction (e.g., MetCCS) is reported to 
generate CCS values in a large-scale. However, the prediction precision is not 
sufficient to differentiate lipids due to their high structural similarities and 
subtle differences on CCS values. To address this challenge, we developed a new 
approach, namely, LipidCCS, to precisely predict lipid CCS values. In LipidCCS, 
a set of molecular descriptors were optimized using bioinformatic approaches to 
comprehensively describe the subtle structure differences for lipids. The use of 
optimized molecular descriptors together with a large set of standard CCS values 
for lipids (458 in total) to build the prediction model significantly improved 
the precision. The prediction precision of LipidCCS was externally validated 
with median relative errors (MRE) of ∼1% using independent data sets across 
different instruments (Agilent DTIM-MS and Waters TWIM-MS) and laboratories. We 
also demonstrated that the improved precision in the predicted LipidCCS database 
(15 646 lipids and 63 434 CCS values in total) could effectively reduce 
false-positive identifications of lipids. Common users can freely access our

The traditional paradigm of cardiovascular disease research derives insight from 
large-scale, broadly inclusive clinical studies of well-characterized 
pathologies. These insights are then put into practice according to standardized 
clinical guidelines. However, stagnation in the development of new 
cardiovascular therapies and variability in therapeutic response implies that 
this paradigm is insufficient for reducing the cardiovascular disease burden. In 
this state-of-the-art review, we examine 3 interconnected ideas we put forth as 
key concepts for enabling a transition to precision cardiology: 
1) precision characterization of cardiovascular disease with machine learning 
methods; 2) the application of network models of disease to embrace disease 
complexity; and 3) using insights from the previous 2 ideas to enable 
pharmacology and polypharmacology systems for more precise drug-to-patient 
matching and patient-disease stratification. We conclude by exploring the 
challenges of applying a precision approach to cardiology, which arise from a 
deficit of the required resources and infrastructure, and emerging evidence for 
the clinical effectiveness of this nascent approach.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Heart failure (HF) is a disease state with great 
heterogeneity, which complicates the therapeutic process. Identifying more 
precise HF phenotypes will allow for the development of more targeted therapies 
and improvement in patient outcomes. This review explores the future for 
precision medicine in HF treatment.
RECENT FINDINGS: Rather than a continuous disease spectrum with a uniform 
pathogenesis, HF has phenotypes with different underlying pathophysiologic 
features. The challenge is to establish clinical phenotypic characterizations to 
direct therapy. Phenomapping, a process of using machine learning algorithms 
applied to clinical data sets, has been used to identify phenotypically distinct 
and clinically meaningful HF groups. As powerful technologies extend our 
knowledge, future analyses may be able to compile more comprehensive phenotypic 
profiles using genetic, epigenetic, proteomic, and metabolomic measurements. 
Identifying clinical characterizations of particular HF patients that would be 
uniquely or disproportionately responsive to a specific treatment would allow 
for more direct selection of optimal therapy, reduce trial-and-error 
prescribing, and help avoid adverse drug reactions.

BACKGROUND: Numerous publications attempt to predict cancer survival outcome 
from gene expression data using machine-learning methods. A direct comparison of 
these works is challenging for the following reasons: (1) inconsistent measures 
used to evaluate the performance of different models, and (2) incomplete 
specification of critical stages in the process of knowledge discovery. There is 
a need for a platform that would allow researchers to replicate previous works 
and to test the impact of changes in the knowledge discovery process on the 
accuracy of the induced models.
RESULTS: We developed the PCM-SABRE platform, which supports the entire 
knowledge discovery process for cancer outcome analysis. PCM-SABRE was developed 
using KNIME. By using PCM-SABRE to reproduce the results of previously published 
works on breast cancer survival, we define a baseline for evaluating future 
attempts to predict cancer outcome with machine learning. We used PCM-SABRE to 
replicate previous work that describe predictive models of breast cancer 
recurrence, and tested the performance of all possible combinations of feature 
selection methods and data mining algorithms that was used in either of the 
works. We reconstructed the work of Chou et al. observing similar trends - 
superior performance of Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and logistic 
regression (LR) algorithms and inconclusive impact of feature pre-selection with 
the decision tree algorithm on subsequent analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: PCM-SABRE is a software tool that provides an intuitive environment 
for rapid development of predictive models in cancer precision medicine.

Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular Apicomplexan parasite and a causative 
agent of toxoplasmosis in human. It causes encephalitis, uveitis, 
chorioretinitis, and congenital infection. T. gondii invades the host cell by 
forming a moving junction (MJ) complex. This complex formation is initiated by 
intermolecular interactions between the two secretory parasitic proteins-namely, 
apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) and rhoptry neck protein 2 (RON2) and is 
critically essential for the host invasion process. By this study, we propose 
two potential leads, NSC95522 and NSC179676 that can efficiently target the AMA1 
hydrophobic cleft, which is a hotspot for targeting MJ complex formation. The 
proposed leads are the result of an exhaustive conformational search-based 
virtual screen with multilevel precision scoring of the docking affinities. 
These two compounds surpassed all the precision levels of docking and also the 
stringent post docking and cumulative molecular dynamics evaluations. Moreover, 
the backbone flexibility of hotspot residues in the hydrophobic cleft, which has 
been previously reported to be essential for accommodative binding of RON2 to 
AMA1, was also highly perturbed by these compounds. Furthermore, binding free 
energy calculations of these two compounds also revealed a significant affinity 
to AMA1. Machine learning approaches also predicted these two compounds to 
possess more relevant activities. Hence, these two leads, NSC95522 and 
NSC179676, may prove to be potential inhibitors targeting AMA1-RON2 complex 
formation towards combating toxoplasmosis.

Credible Intervals for Precision and Recall Based on a K-Fold Cross-Validated 
Beta Distribution.

In typical machine learning applications such as information retrieval, 
precision and recall are two commonly used measures for assessing an algorithm's 
performance. Symmetrical confidence intervals based on K-fold cross-validated t 
distributions are widely used for the inference of precision and recall 
measures. As we confirmed through simulated experiments, however, these 
confidence intervals often exhibit lower degrees of confidence, which may easily 
lead to liberal inference results. Thus, it is crucial to construct faithful 
confidence (credible) intervals for precision and recall with a high degree of 
confidence and a short interval length. In this study, we propose two posterior 
credible intervals for precision and recall based on K-fold cross-validated beta 
distributions. The first credible interval for precision (or recall) is 
constructed based on the beta posterior distribution inferred by all K data sets 
corresponding to K confusion matrices from a K-fold cross-validation. Second, 
considering that each data set corresponding to a confusion matrix from a K-fold 
cross-validation can be used to infer a beta posterior distribution of precision 
(or recall), the second proposed credible interval for precision (or recall) is 
constructed based on the average of K beta posterior distributions. Experimental 
results on simulated and real data sets demonstrate that the first credible 
interval proposed in this study almost always resulted in degrees of confidence 
greater than 95%. With an acceptable degree of confidence, both of our two 
proposed credible intervals have shorter interval lengths than those based on a 
corrected K-fold cross-validated t distribution. Meanwhile, the average ranks of 
these two credible intervals are superior to that of the confidence interval 
based on a K-fold cross-validated t distribution for the degree of confidence 
and are superior to that of the confidence interval based on a corrected K-fold 
cross-validated t distribution for the interval length in all 27 cases of 
simulated and real data experiments. However, the confidence intervals based on 
the K-fold and corrected K-fold cross-validated t distributions are in the two 
extremes. Thus, when focusing on the reliability of the inference for precision 
and recall, the proposed methods are preferable, especially for the first 
credible interval.

Since the first human cancer cell line, HeLa, was established in the early 
1950s, there has been a steady increase in the number and tumor type of 
available cancer cell line models. Cancer cell lines have made significant 
contributions to the development of various chemotherapeutic agents. Recent 
advances in multi-omics technologies have facilitated detailed characterizations 
of the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic profiles of these 
cancer cell lines. An increasing number of studies employ the power of a cancer 
cell line panel to provide predictive biomarkers for targeted and cytotoxic 
agents, including those that are already used in clinical practice. Different 
types of statistical and machine learning algorithms have been developed to 
analyze the large-scale data sets that have been produced. However, much work 
remains to address the discrepancies in drug assay results from different 
platforms and the frequent failures to translate discoveries from cell line 
models to the clinic. Nevertheless, continuous expansion of cancer cell line 
panels should provide unprecedented opportunities to identify new candidate 
targeted therapies, particularly for the so-called "dark matter" group of 
cancers, for which pharmacologically tractable driver mutations have not been 
identified.

Many time-consuming analyses of next -: generation sequencing data can be 
addressed with modern cloud computing. The Apache Hadoop-based solutions have 
become popular in genomics BECAUSE OF: their scalability in a cloud 
infrastructure. So far, most of these tools have been used for batch data 
processing rather than interactive data querying. The SparkSeq software has been 
created to take advantage of a new MapReduce framework, Apache Spark, for 
next-generation sequencing data. SparkSeq is a general-purpose, flexible and 
easily extendable library for genomic cloud computing. It can be used to build 
genomic analysis pipelines in Scala and run them in an interactive way. SparkSeq 
opens up the possibility of customized ad hoc secondary analyses and iterative 
machine learning algorithms. This article demonstrates its scalability and 
overall fast performance by running the analyses of sequencing datasets. Tests 
of SparkSeq also prove that the use of cache and HDFS block size can be tuned 
for the optimal performance on multiple worker nodes.

The main goal of psychiatric high-risk research--the personalised early 
recognition and intervention of schizophrenic and affective psychoses--is one of 
the biggest challenges of current clinical psychiatry due to the immense 
socioeconomic burden of these disorders. In this regard, this review discusses 
the prospects and caveats of new clinical, neuropsychological, 
neurophysiological and imaging-based concepts aimed at optimising the current 
state-of-the-art of early recognition. Finally, multivariate modelling and 
machine learning methods are presented as a novel methodological framework 
facilitating the decoding of early psychosis into different intermediate 
phenotypes. In the future, these phenotypes could be employed for a more 
objective risk stratification that operates at the single-subject level. This 
could allow us to generate clinically applicable prognostic biomarkers for these 
disorders that would propel the individualised prevention of disease transition, 
chronification and psychopharmacological treatment resistance of psychotic 
disorders.

OBJECTIVE: Rough set theory (RST) provides powerful methods for reduction of 
attributes and creation of decision rules, which have successfully been applied 
in numerous medical applications. The variable precision rough set model (VPRS 
model), an extension of the original rough set approach, tolerates some degree 
of misclassification of the training data. The basic idea of the VPRS model is 
to change the class information of those objects whose class information cannot 
be induced without contradiction from the available attributes. Thereafter, 
original methods of RST are applied. An approach of this model is presented that 
allows uncertain objects to change class information during the process of 
attribute reduction and rule generation. This method is referred to as variable 
precision rough set approach with flexible classification of uncertain objects 
(VPRS(FC) approach) and needs only slight modifications of the original VPRS 
model.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: To compare the VPRS model and VPRS(FC) approach both 
methods are applied to a clinical data set based on electroencephalogram of 
awake and anesthetized patients. For comparison, a second data set obtained from 
the UCI machine learning repository is used. It describes the shape of different 
vehicle types. Further well known feature selection methods were applied to both 
data sets to compare their results with the results provided by rough set based 
approaches.
RESULTS: The VPRS(FC) approach requires higher computational effort, but is able 
to achieve better reduction of attributes for noisy or inconsistent data and 
provides smaller rule sets.
CONCLUSION: The presented approach is a useful method for substantial attribute 
reduction in noisy and inconsistent data sets.

Next-generation medicine encompasses different concepts related to healthcare 
models and technological developments. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 
healthcare systems are quite different between countries, and cancer control is 
known to be insufficient and inefficient considering socioeconomically 
discrepancies. Despite advancements in knowledge about the biology of different 
oncological diseases, the disease remains a challenge in terms of diagnosis, 
treatment, and prognosis for clinicians and researchers. With the development of 
molecular biology, better diagnosis methods, and therapeutic tools in the last 
years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become important, because it could 
improve different clinical scenarios: predicting clinically relevant parameters, 
cancer diagnosis, cancer research, and accelerating the growth of personalized 
medicine. The incorporation of AI represents an important challenge in terms of 
diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis for clinicians and researchers in cancer 
care. Therefore, some studies about AI in Latin America and the Caribbean are 
being conducted with the aim to improve the performance of AI in those 
countries. This review introduces AI in cancer care in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, and the advantages and promising results that it has shown in this 
socio-demographic context.

Interventions to teach protective behaviors may be differentially effective 
within an adolescent population. Identifying the characteristics of youth who 
are less likely to respond to an intervention can guide program modifications to 
improve its effectiveness. Using comprehensive longitudinal data on adolescent 
risk behaviors, perceptions, sensation-seeking, peer and family influence, and 
neighborhood risk factors from 2564 grade 10-12 students in The Bahamas, this 
study employs machine learning approaches (support vector machines, logistic 
regression, decision tree, and random forest) to identify important predictors 
of non-responsiveness for precision prevention. We used 80% of the data to train 
the models and the rest for model testing. Among different machine learning 
algorithms, the random forest model using longitudinal data and the Boruta 
feature selection approach predicted intervention non-responsiveness best, 
achieving sensitivity of 85.4%, specificity of 78.4% and AUROC of 0.93 on the 
training data, and sensitivity of 84.3%, specificity of 67.1%, and AUROC of 0.85 
on the test data. Key predictors include self-efficacy, perceived response cost, 
parent monitoring, vulnerability, response efficacy, HIV/AIDS knowledge, 
communication about condom use, and severity of HIV/STI. Machine learning can 
yield powerful predictive models to identify adolescents who are unlikely to 
respond to an intervention. Such models can guide the development of alternative 
strategies that may be more effective with intervention non-responders.

The precision spray of liquid fertilizer and pesticide to plants is an important 
task for agricultural robots in precision agriculture. By reducing the amount of 
chemicals being sprayed, it brings in a more economic and eco-friendly solution 
compared to conventional non-discriminated spray. The prerequisite of precision 
spray is to detect and track each plant. Conventional detection or segmentation 
methods detect all plants in the image captured under the robotic platform, 
without knowing the ID of the plant. To spray pesticides to each plant exactly 
once, tracking of every plant is needed in addition to detection. In this paper, 
we present LettuceTrack, a novel Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) method to 
simultaneously detect and track lettuces. When the ID of each plant is obtained 
from the tracking method, the robot knows whether a plant has been sprayed 
before therefore it will only spray the plant that has not been sprayed. The 
proposed method adopts YOLO-V5 for detection of the lettuces, and a novel plant 
feature extraction and data association algorithms are introduced to effectively 
track all plants. The proposed method can recover the ID of a plant even if the 
plant moves out of the field of view of camera before, for which existing 
Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) methods usually fail and assign a new plant ID. 
Experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and 
a comparison with four state-of-the-art Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) methods 
is shown to prove the superior performance of the proposed method in the lettuce 
tracking application and its limitations. Though the proposed method is tested 
with lettuce, it can be potentially applied to other vegetables such as broccoli 
or sugar beat.

Radiogenomics refers to the study of the relationship between imaging phenotypes 
and gene expression patterns/molecular characteristics, which might allow 
improved diagnosis, decision-making, and predicting patient outcomes in the 
context of multiple diseases. Central nervous system (CNS) tumours contribute to 
significant cancer-related mortality in the present age. Although historically 
CNS neoplasms were classified and graded based on microscopic appearance, there 
was discordance between two histologically similar tumours that showed varying 
prognosis and behaviour, attributable to their molecular signatures. These led 
to the incorporation of molecular markers in the classification of CNS 
neoplasms. Meanwhile, advancements in imaging technology such as diffusion-based 
imaging (including tractography), perfusion, and spectroscopy in addition to the 
conventional imaging of glial neoplasms, have opened an avenue for 
radiogenomics. This review touches upon the schema of the current classification 
of gliomas, concepts behind molecular markers, and parameters that are used in 
radiogenomics to characterise gliomas and the role of artificial intelligence 
for the same. Further, the role of radiomics in the grading of brain tumours, 
prediction of treatment response and prognosis has been discussed. Use of 
automated and semi-automated tumour segmentation for radiotherapy planning and 
follow-up has also been discussed briefly.

Fondazione Bruno Kessler is developing a mobile app prototype for empowering 
citizens to improve their health conditions through different lifestyle 
interventions that will be incorporated into a mobile application for lifestyle 
promotion of the Province of Trento in the context of the Trentino Salute 4.0 
Competence Center. The envisioned interventions are based on promoting behaviour 
change in various domains such as physical activity, mental health and 
nutrition. In particular, the nutrition component is a self-monitoring module 
that collects dietary habits to analyse them and recommend healthier eating 
behaviours. Dietary assessment is completed using a Food Frequency Questionnaire 
on the Mediterranean diet that is presented to the user as a grid of images. The 
questionnaire returns feedback on 11 aspects of nutrition. Although the 
questionnaire used in the application only consists of 24 questions, it still 
could be a bit overwhelming and a bit crowded when shown on the screen. In this 
paper, we tried to find a machine-learning-based solution to reduce the number 
of questions in the questionnaire. We proposed a method that uses the user's 
previous answers as additional information to find the goals that need more 
attention. We compared this method with a case where the subset of questions is 
randomly selected and with a case where the subset is chosen using feature 
selection. We also explored how large the subset should be to obtain good 
predictions. All the experiments are conducted as a multi-target regression 
problem, which means several goals are predicted simultaneously. The proposed 
method adjusts well to the user in question and has the slightest error when 
predicting the goals.

High-precision lithography thick-mask model based on a decomposition machine 
learning method.

Li Z, Dong L, Jing X, Ma X, Wei Y.

The thick-mask model had been used to simulate the diffraction behavior of the 
three-dimensional photomask in optical lithography system. By exploring the edge 
interference effect that appears in the diffraction near-field (DNF), an 
improved thick-mask model with high precision is proposed. The diffraction 
transfer matrix (DTM) is introduced to represent the transformation from the 
layout pattern to the corresponding DNF. In this method, the DTM is learned from 
a training library including the rigorous DNF of some representative mask clips. 
Given a thick-mask pattern, it is firstly decomposed into a set of segments 
around the sampling points at corners and edges. Then, the local DNF of each 
segment is calculated based on the corresponding DTM. Finally, all the local DNF 
segments are synthesized together to simulate the entire thick-mask DNF. The 
results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the simulation 
accuracy compared to the traditional filter-based method, meanwhile retaining a 
high computation speed.

Encapsulation of cells inside microfluidic droplets is central to several 
applications involving cellular analysis. Although, theoretically the 
encapsulation statistics are expected to follow a Poisson distribution, 
experimentally this may not be achieved due to lack of full control of the 
experimental variables and conditions. Therefore, there is a need for automatic 
detection of droplets and cell count enumeration within droplets so a process 
control feedback to adjust experimental conditions can be implemented. In this 
study, we use a deep learning object detector called You Only Look Once (YOLO), 
an influential class of object detectors with several benefits over traditional 
methods. This paper investigates the application of both YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 
object detectors in the development of an automated droplet and cell detector. 
Experimental data was obtained from a microfluidic flow focusing device with a 
dispersed phase of cancer cells. The microfluidic device contained an expansion 
chamber downstream of the droplet generator, allowing for visualization and 
recording of cell-encapsulated droplet images. In the procedure, a droplet 
bounding box is predicted, then cropped from the original image for the 
individual cells to be detected through a separate model for further 
examination. The system includes a production set for additional performance 
analysis with Poisson statistics while providing an experimental workflow with 
both droplet and cell models. The training set is collected and preprocessed 
before labeling and applying image augmentations, allowing for a generalizable 
object detector. Precision and recall were utilized as a validation and test set 
metric, resulting in a high mean average precision (mAP) metric for an accurate 
droplet detector. To examine model limitations, the predictions were compared to 
ground truth labels, illustrating that the YOLO predictions closely matched with 
the droplet and cell labels. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that droplet 
enumeration from the YOLOv5 model is consistent with hand counted ratios and the 
Poisson distribution, confirming that the platform can be used in real-time 
experiments for cell encapsulation optimization.

Recent advances in Deep Learning (DL) fueled the interest in developing 
neuromorphic hardware accelerators that can improve the computational speed and 
energy efficiency of existing accelerators. Among the most promising research 
directions towards this is photonic neuromorphic architectures, which can 
achieve femtojoule per MAC efficiencies. Despite the benefits that arise from 
the use of neuromorphic architectures, a significant bottleneck is the use of 
expensive high-speed and precision analog-to-digital (ADCs) and 
digital-to-analog conversion modules (DACs) required to transfer the electrical 
signals, originating from the various Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) 
operations (inputs, weights, etc.) in the photonic optical engines. The main 
contribution of this paper is to study quantization phenomena in photonic 
models, induced by DACs/ADCs, as an additional noise/uncertainty source and to 
provide a photonics-compliant framework for training photonic DL models with 
limited precision, allowing for reducing the need for expensive high precision 
DACs/ADCs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using 
different architectures, ranging from fully connected and convolutional networks 
to recurrent architectures, following recent advances in photonic DL.

It has been well established that understanding the underlying heterogeneity of 
numerous complex disease process needs new strategies that present in precision 
medicine for prediction, prevention and personalized treatment strategies. This 
approach must be tailored for each individual's unique omics that lead to 
personalized management of disease. The correlation between different omics data 
should be considered in precision medicine approach. The interaction provides a 
hypothesis which is called domino effect in the present minireview. Here we 
review the various potentials of omics data including genomics, transcriptomics, 
proteomics, metabolomics, pharmacogenomics. We comprehensively summarize the 
impact of omics data and its major role in precision medicine and provide a 
description about the domino effect on the pathophysiology of diseases. Each 
constituent of the omics data typically provides different information in 
associated with disease. Current research, although inadequate, clearly indicate 
that the information of omics data can be applicable in the concept of precision 
medicine. Integration of different omics data type in domino effect hypothesis 
can explain the causative changes of disease as it is discussed in the system 
biology too. While most existing studies investigate the omics data separately, 
data integration is needed on the horizon of precision medicine by using machine 
learning.

High-throughput technologies used in molecular biology have been pivotal to 
enhance the molecular characterization of human malignancies, allowing multiple 
omics data types to be available for cancer researchers and practitioners. In 
this context, appropriate data integration strategies are required to gain new 
insights from omics high-dimensional data. Yet, in order to extract valuable 
knowledge from this kind of information in an efficient manner, different 
approaches to reduce data dimensionality should be considered in multi-omics 
data integration pipelines. Multi-omics data integration approaches are mainly 
classified according to the label availability. Unsupervised data integration 
only draws inference from inputs without prior labels, whereas its supervised 
counterpart models allow incorporating known phenotype labels to improve the 
accuracy of high-throughput biomedical data analyses. However, the real value of 
the above mentioned approaches lies in their sequential combination with machine 
learning methods. It represents a major challenge for implementing multi-omics 
data analysis pipelines but it can certainly improve the decision-making process 
in the diagnosis and clinical management of cancer. The present review addresses 
the impact of current multi-omics data integration approaches, and their synergy 
with machine learning approaches, on the precision oncology field.

The management of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer is still 
debated. Several therapeutic options and treatment strategies are available for 
an extremely heterogeneous clinical scenario. Adequate prediction of patients' 
outcomes and of the effectiveness of chemotherapy and loco-regional treatments 
are crucial to reach a precision medicine approach. This has been an unmet need 
for a long time, but recent studies have opened new perspectives. New 
morphological biomarkers have been identified. The dynamic evaluation of the 
metastases across a time interval, with or without chemotherapy, provided a 
reliable assessment of the tumor biology. Genetics have been explored and, 
thanks to their strong association with prognosis, have the potential to drive 
treatment planning. The liver-tumor interface has been identified as one of the 
main determinants of tumor progression, and its components, in particular the 
immune infiltrate, are the focus of major research. Image mining and analyses 
provided new insights on tumor biology and are expected to have a relevant 
impact on clinical practice. Artificial intelligence is a further step forward. 
The present paper depicts the evolution of clinical decision-making for patients 
affected by colorectal liver metastases, facing modern biomarkers and innovative 
opportunities that will characterize the evolution of clinical research and 
practice in the next few years.

BACKGROUND: Measurement of cardiac structure and function from images (e.g. 
volumes, mass and derived parameters such as left ventricular (LV) ejection 
fraction [LVEF]) guides care for millions. This is best assessed using 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), but image analysis is currently 
performed by individual clinicians, which introduces error. We sought to develop 
a machine learning algorithm for volumetric analysis of CMR images with 
demonstrably better precision than human analysis.
METHODS: A fully automated machine learning algorithm was trained on 1923 scans 
(10 scanner models, 13 institutions, 9 clinical conditions, 60,000 contours) and 
used to segment the LV blood volume and myocardium. Performance was quantified 
by measuring precision on an independent multi-site validation dataset with 
multiple pathologies with n = 109 patients, scanned twice. This dataset was 
augmented with a further 1277 patients scanned as part of routine clinical care 
to allow qualitative assessment of generalization ability by identifying 
mis-segmentations. Machine learning algorithm ('machine') performance was 
compared to three clinicians ('human') and a commercial tool (cvi42, Circle 
Cardiovascular Imaging).
FINDINGS: Machine analysis was quicker (20 s per patient) than human (13 min). 
Overall machine mis-segmentation rate was 1 in 479 images for the combined 
dataset, occurring mostly in rare pathologies not encountered in training. 
Without correcting these mis-segmentations, machine analysis had superior 
precision to three clinicians (e.g. scan-rescan coefficients of variation of 
human vs machine: LVEF 6.0% vs 4.2%, LV mass 4.8% vs. 3.6%; both P < 0.05), 
translating to a 46% reduction in required trial sample size using an LVEF 
endpoint.
CONCLUSION: We present a fully automated algorithm for measuring LV structure 
and global systolic function that betters human performance for speed and 
precision.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's 
disease, affect several million individuals worldwide. These diseases are 
heterogeneous at the clinical, immunological and genetic levels and result from 
complex host and environmental interactions. Investigating drug efficacy for IBD 
can improve our understanding of why treatment response can vary between 
patients. We propose an explainable machine learning (ML) approach that combines 
bioinformatics and domain insight, to integrate multi-modal data and predict 
inter-patient variation in drug response. Using explanation of our models, we 
interpret the ML models' predictions to infer unique combinations of important 
features associated with pharmacological responses obtained during preclinical 
testing of drug candidates in ex vivo patient-derived fresh tissues. Our 
inferred multi-modal features that are predictive of drug efficacy include 
multi-omic data (genomic and transcriptomic), demographic, medicinal and 
pharmacological data. Our aim is to understand variation in patient responses 
before a drug candidate moves forward to clinical trials. As a pharmacological 
measure of drug efficacy, we measured the reduction in the release of the 
inflammatory cytokine TNFα from the fresh IBD tissues in the presence/absence of 
test drugs. We initially explored the effects of a mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MAPK) inhibitor; however, we later showed our approach can be applied to 
other targets, test drugs or mechanisms of interest. Our best model predicted 
TNFα levels from demographic, medicinal and genomic features with an error of 
only 4.98% on unseen patients. We incorporated transcriptomic data to validate 
insights from genomic features. Our results showed variations in drug 
effectiveness (measured by ex vivo assays) between patients that differed in 
gender, age or condition and linked new genetic polymorphisms to patient 
response variation to the anti-inflammatory treatment BIRB796 (Doramapimod). Our 
approach models IBD drug response while also identifying its most predictive 
features as part of a transparent ML precision medicine strategy.

IMPORTANCE: Early detection and characterization of increased left ventricular 
(LV) wall thickness can markedly impact patient care but is limited by 
under-recognition of hypertrophy, measurement error and variability, and 
difficulty differentiating causes of increased wall thickness, such as 
hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac amyloidosis.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of a deep learning workflow in quantifying 
ventricular hypertrophy and predicting the cause of increased LV wall thickness.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included physician-curated 
cohorts from the Stanford Amyloid Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) 
Advanced Heart Disease Clinic for cardiac amyloidosis and the Stanford Center 
for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease and the CSMC Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy 
Clinic for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 
2020. The deep learning algorithm was trained and tested on retrospectively 
obtained independent echocardiogram videos from Stanford Healthcare, CSMC, and 
the Unity Imaging Collaborative.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the accuracy of the deep 
learning algorithm in measuring left ventricular dimensions and identifying 
patients with increased LV wall thickness diagnosed with hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy and cardiac amyloidosis.
RESULTS: The study included 23 745 patients: 12 001 from Stanford Health Care 
(6509 [54.2%] female; mean [SD] age, 61.6 [17.4] years) and 1309 from CSMC (808 
[61.7%] female; mean [SD] age, 62.8 [17.2] years) with parasternal long-axis 
videos and 8084 from Stanford Health Care (4201 [54.0%] female; mean [SD] age, 
69.1 [16.8] years) and 2351 from CSMS (6509 [54.2%] female; mean [SD] age, 69.6 
[14.7] years) with apical 4-chamber videos. The deep learning algorithm 
accurately measured intraventricular wall thickness (mean absolute error [MAE], 
1.2 mm; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3 mm), LV diameter (MAE, 2.4 mm; 95% CI, 2.2-2.6 mm), and 
posterior wall thickness (MAE, 1.4 mm; 95% CI, 1.2-1.5 mm) and classified 
cardiac amyloidosis (area under the curve [AUC], 0.83) and hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (AUC, 0.98) separately from other causes of LV hypertrophy. In 
external data sets from independent domestic and international health care 
systems, the deep learning algorithm accurately quantified ventricular 
parameters (domestic: R2, 0.96; international: R2, 0.90). For the domestic data 
set, the MAE was 1.7 mm (95% CI, 1.6-1.8 mm) for intraventricular septum 
thickness, 3.8 mm (95% CI, 3.5-4.0 mm) for LV internal dimension, and 1.8 mm 
(95% CI, 1.7-2.0 mm) for LV posterior wall thickness. For the international data 
set, the MAE was 1.7 mm (95% CI, 1.5-2.0 mm) for intraventricular septum 
thickness, 2.9 mm (95% CI, 2.4-3.3 mm) for LV internal dimension, and 2.3 mm 
(95% CI, 1.9-2.7 mm) for LV posterior wall thickness. The deep learning 
algorithm accurately detected cardiac amyloidosis (AUC, 0.79) and hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (AUC, 0.89) in the domestic external validation site.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, the deep learning model 
accurately identified subtle changes in LV wall geometric measurements and the 
causes of hypertrophy. Unlike with human experts, the deep learning workflow is 
fully automated, allowing for reproducible, precise measurements, and may 
provide a foundation for precision diagnosis of cardiac hypertrophy.

OBJECTIVE: A key component for precision medicine is a good prediction algorithm 
for patients' response to treatments. We aim to implement machine learning (ML) 
algorithms into the response-adaptive randomization (RAR) design and improve the 
treatment outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We incorporated 9 ML algorithms to model the relationship 
of patient responses and biomarkers in clinical trial design. Such a model 
predicted the response rate of each treatment for each new patient and provide 
guidance for treatment assignment. Realizing that no single method may fit all 
trials well, we also built an ensemble of these 9 methods. We evaluated their 
performance through quantifying the benefits for trial participants, such as the 
overall response rate and the percentage of patients who receive their optimal 
treatments.
RESULTS: Simulation studies showed that the adoption of ML methods resulted in 
more personalized optimal treatment assignments and higher overall response 
rates among trial participants. Compared with each individual ML method, the 
ensemble approach achieved the highest response rate and assigned the largest 
percentage of patients to their optimal treatments. For the real-world study, we 
successfully showed the potential improvements if the proposed design had been 
implemented in the study.
CONCLUSION: In summary, the ML-based RAR design is a promising approach for 
assigning more patients to their personalized effective treatments, which makes 
the clinical trial more ethical and appealing. These features are especially 
desirable for late-stage cancer patients who have failed all the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved treatment options and only can get new treatments 
through clinical trials.

An increased risk of cardiovascular events was identified in patients with 
peripheral artery disease (PAD). Clopidogrel is one of the most widely used 
antiplatelet medications. However, there are heterogeneous outcomes when 
clopidogrel is used to prevent cardiovascular events in PAD patients. Here, we 
use an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted methodology to identify genetic 
factors potentially involved in the clopidogrel-resistant mechanism, which is 
currently unclear. Several discoveries can be pinpointed. Firstly, a high 
proportion (>50%) of clopidogrel resistance was found among diabetic PAD 
patients in Taiwan. Interestingly, our result suggests that platelet function 
test-guided antiplatelet therapy appears to reduce the post-interventional 
occurrence of major adverse cerebrovascular and cardiac events in diabetic PAD 
patients. Secondly, AI-assisted genome-wide association study of a 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database identified a SNP signature 
composed of 20 SNPs, which are mapped into 9 protein-coding genes (SLC37A2, 
IQSEC1, WASHC3, PSD3, BTBD7, GLIS3, PRDM11, LRBA1, and CNR1). Finally, analysis 
of the protein connectivity map revealed that LRBA, GLIS3, BTBD7, IQSEC1, and 
PSD3 appear to form a protein interaction network. Intriguingly, the genetic 
factors seem to pinpoint a pathway related to endocytosis and recycling of P2Y12 
receptor, which is the drug target of clopidogrel. Our findings reveal that a 
combination of AI-assisted discovery of SNP signatures and clinical parameters 
has the potential to develop an ethnic-specific precision medicine for 
antiplatelet therapy in diabetic PAD patients.

Molecular imaging is one of the pillars of precision surgery. Its applications 
range from early diagnostics to therapy planning, execution, and the accurate 
assessment of outcomes. In particular, molecular imaging solutions are in high 
demand in minimally invasive surgical strategies, such as the substantially 
increasing field of robotic surgery. This review aims at connecting the 
molecular imaging and nuclear medicine community to the rapidly expanding armory 
of surgical medical devices. Such devices entail technologies ranging from 
artificial intelligence and computer-aided visualization technologies (software) 
to innovative molecular imaging modalities and surgical navigation (hardware). 
We discuss technologies based on their role at different steps of the surgical 
workflow, i.e., from surgical decision and planning, over to target localization 
and excision guidance, all the way to (back table) surgical verification. This 
provides a glimpse of how innovations from the technology fields can realize an 
exciting future for the molecular imaging and surgery communities.

INTRODUCTION: Fluorescence angiography (FA) with indocyanine green (ICG) and 
hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are novel intraoperative visualization techniques in 
abdominal, vascular and transplant surgery. With the purpose of precision 
surgery, and in order to increase patient's safety, these new tools aim at 
reducing postoperative morbidity and mortality. This review discusses and 
highlights recent developments and the future potential of real-time imaging 
modalities.
METHODS: The underlying mechanisms of the novel imaging methods and their 
clinical impact are displayed in the context of avoiding anastomotic leaks, the 
most momentous complications in gastrointestinal surgery after oncologic 
resections.
RESULTS: While FA is associated with the admission of a fluorescence agent, HSI 
is contact-free and non-invasive. Both methods are able to record physiological 
tissue properties in real-time. Additionally, FA also measures dynamic 
phenomena. The techniques take a few seconds only and do not hamper the 
operative workflow considerably. With regard to a potential change of the 
surgical strategy, FA and HSI have an equal significance. Our own advancements 
reflect, in particular, the topics of data visualization and automated data 
analyses together with the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and 
minimalization of the current devices to install them into endoscopes, 
minimal-invasive and robot-guided surgery.
CONCLUSION: There are a limited number of studies in the field of intraoperative 
imaging techniques. Whether precision surgery in the "high-tech" OR together 
with FA, HSI and robotics will result in more secure operative procedures to 
minimize the postoperative morbidity and mortality will have to be evaluated in 
future multicenter trials.

Publisher: HINTERGRUND: Die Fluoreszenz-Angiografie (FA) mit Indocyanin-Grün 
(ICG) und das Hyperspektral-Imaging (HSI) sind neue intraoperative 
Visualisierungsmöglichkeiten in der Abdominal-, Gefäß- und 
Transplantationschirurgie. Ziel ist es, damit die postoperative Morbidität und 
Mortalität im Sinne der Präzisionschirurgie und Patientensicherheit zu 
reduzieren. In diesem Artikel werden aktuelle Daten und das zukünftige 
innovative Potenzial der Echtzeit-Bildgebungsmodalitäten hervorgehoben.
METHODEN: Das Prinzip der neuen „Imaging“-Verfahren und deren klinische 
Anwendungen werden aufgearbeitet mit Blick auf Anastomoseninsuffizienzen, die 
die folgenschwersten Komplikationen in der gastrointestinalen Chirurgie nach 
onkologischen Resektionen darstellen.
ERGEBNISSE: Während die FA die Gabe eines Fluoreszenzfarbstoffs erfordert, ist 
HSI völlig kontaktfrei und nichtinvasiv. Beide Methoden können in 
„Real-Time“-Applikation physiologische Gewebeeigenschaften, zudem die FA auch 
dynamische Phänomene, erfassen. Die Verfahren dauern nur wenige Sekunden und 
stören den operativen Ablauf nicht wesentlich. Sie sind hinsichtlich ihrer 
Aussagekraft für eine mögliche Änderung der operativen Strategie als 
komplementär zu betrachten. Unsere eigenen Weiterentwicklungen der Modalitäten 
liegen insbesondere im Bereich der Datenvisualisierung sowie der automatischen 
Datenanalyse unter Einsatz der künstlichen Intelligenz (KI) und der 
Miniaturisierung der bisherigen Geräte für einen zukünftigen Einsatz in der 
Endoskopie, der minimalinvasiven und der roboterassistierten Chirurgie.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Insgesamt ist die Zahl der Studien im Forschungsfeld der 
intraoperativen Bildgebung zurzeit noch sehr limitiert. Ob diese neue Art der 
Präzisionschirurgie im „Hightech“-OP mit der Kombination aus HSI, FA und Robotik 
zu einer verbesserten Patientensicherheit durch Minimierung der postoperativen 
Morbidität und Mortalität führt, muss in weiterführenden multizentrischen 
Studien evaluiert werden.

OBJECTIVE: Established and emerging technologies-such as wearable sensors, 
smartphones, mobile apps, and artificial intelligence-are shaping positive 
healthcare models and patient outcomes. These technologies have the potential to 
become precision health (PH) innovations. However, not all innovations meet 
regulatory standards or have the required scientific evidence to be used for 
health applications. In response, an assessment framework was developed to 
facilitate and standardize the assessment of innovations deemed suitable for PH.
METHODS: A scoping literature review undertaken through PubMed and Google 
Scholar identified approximately 100 relevant articles. These were then 
shortlisted (n = 12) to those that included specific metrics, criteria, or 
frameworks for assessing technologies that could be applied to the PH context.
RESULTS: The proposed framework identified nine core criteria with subcriteria 
and grouped them into four categories for assessment: technical, clinical, human 
factors, and implementation. Guiding statements with response options and 
recommendations were used as metrics against each criterion.
CONCLUSION: The proposed framework supports health services, health technology 
innovators, and researchers in leveraging current and emerging technologies for 
PH innovations. It covers a comprehensive set of criteria as part of the 
assessment process of these technologies.

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) represents one of the most challenging 
complications after total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Despite the availability of 
a variety of diagnostic techniques, the diagnosis of PJI remains a challenge due 
to the lack of well-established diagnostic criteria. The leucocyte esterase (LE) 
strips test has been proved to be a valuable diagnostic tool for PJI, and its 
weight in PJI diagnostic criteria has gradually increased. Characterized by its 
convenience, speed and immediacy, leucocyte esterase strips test has a prospect 
of broad application in PJI diagnosis. Admittedly, the leucocyte esterase strips 
test has some limitations, such as imprecision and liability to interference. 
Thanks to the application of new technologies, such as machine reading, 
quantitative detection and artificial intelligence, the LE strips test is 
expected to overcome the limitations and improve its accuracy.

The purpose of this work is to introduce a novel deep learning strategy to 
obtain highly accurate dose plan by transforming from a dose distribution 
calculated using a low-cost algorithm (or algorithmic settings). 25 168 slices 
of dose distribution are calculated using Eclipse treatment planning system 
V15.6 (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) on ten patient CTs whose treatment 
sites ranging from lung, brain, abdomen and pelvis, with a grid size of 
1.25  ×  1.25  ×  1.25 mm using both anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA) in 
5 mm resolution and Acuros XB algorithm (AXB) in 1.25 mm resolution. The AAA 
dose slices, and the corresponding down sampled CT slices are combined to form a 
tensor with a size of 2  ×  64  ×  64, working as the input to the deep 
learning-based dose calculation network (deep DoseNet), which outputs the 
calculated Acuros dose with a size of 256  ×  256. The deep DoseNet (DDN) 
consists of a feature extraction component and an upscaling part. The DDN 
converges after ~100 epochs with a learning rate of [Formula: see text], using 
ADAM. We compared up sampled AAA dose and DDN output with that of AXB. For the 
evaluation set, the average mean-square-error decreased from 4.7  ×  [Formula: 
see text] between AAA and AXB to 7.0  ×  10-5 between DDN and AXB, with an 
average improvement of ~12 times. The average Gamma index passing rate at 3mm3% 
improved from 76% between AAA and AXB to 91% between DDN and AXB. The average 
calculation time is less than 1 ms for a single slice on a NVIDIA DGX 
workstation. DDN, trained with a large amount of dosimetric data, can be 
employed as a general-purpose dose calculation acceleration engine across 
various dose calculation algorithms.

Molecular tests are necessary to stratify cancer patients for targeted therapy. 
However, high cost and technical barriers limit the application of these tests, 
hindering optimal treatment. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been applied to 
predict molecular test results from digitized images of tissue slides. 
Furthermore, treatment response and prognosis can be predicted from tissue 
slides using DL. In this review, we summarized DL-based studies regarding the 
prediction of genetic mutation, microsatellite instability, tumor mutational 
burden, molecular subtypes, gene expression, treatment response, and prognosis 
directly from hematoxylin- and eosin-stained tissue slides. Although performance 
needs to be improved, these studies clearly demonstrated the feasibility of 
DL-based prediction of key molecular features in cancer tissues. With the 
accumulation of data and technical advances, the performance of the DL system 
could be improved in the near future. Therefore, we expect that DL could provide 
cost- and time-effective alternative tools for patient stratification in the era 
of precision oncology.

In advancing precision psychiatry, we focus on what imaging technology and 
computational approaches offer for the future of diagnostic subtyping and 
personalized tailoring of interventions for sleep impairment in mood and anxiety 
disorders. Current diagnostic criteria for mood and anxiety tend to lump 
different forms of sleep disturbance together. Parsing the biological features 
of sleep impairment and brain circuit dysfunction is one approach to identifying 
subtypes within these disorders that are mechanistically coherent and offer 
targets for intervention. We focus on two large-scale neural circuits implicated 
in sleep impairment and in mood and anxiety disorders: the default mode network 
and negative affective network. Through a synthesis of existing knowledge about 
these networks, we pose a testable framework for understanding how hyper- versus 
hypo-engagement of these networks may underlie distinct features of mood and 
sleep impairment. Within this framework we consider whether poor sleep quality 
may have an explanatory role in previously observed associations between network 
dysfunction and mood symptoms. We expand this framework to future directions 
including the potential for connecting circuit-defined subtypes to more distal 
features derived from digital phenotyping and wearable technologies, and how new 
discovery may be advanced through machine learning approaches.

More than 400,000 deaths from severe malaria (SM) are reported every year, 
mainly in African children. The diversity of clinical presentations associated 
with SM indicates important differences in disease pathogenesis that require 
specific treatment, and this clinical heterogeneity of SM remains poorly 
understood. Here, we apply tools from machine learning and model-based inference 
to harness large-scale data and dissect the heterogeneity in patterns of 
clinical features associated with SM in 2904 Gambian children admitted to 
hospital with malaria. This quantitative analysis reveals features predicting 
the severity of individual patient outcomes, and the dynamic pathways of SM 
progression, notably inferred without requiring longitudinal observations. 
Bayesian inference of these pathways allows us assign quantitative mortality 
risks to individual patients. By independently surveying expert practitioners, 
we show that this data-driven approach agrees with and expands the current state 
of knowledge on malaria progression, while simultaneously providing a 
data-supported framework for predicting clinical risk.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology are two fields that are 
instrumental in realizing the goal of precision medicine-tailoring the best 
treatment for each cancer patient. Recent conversion between these two fields is 
enabling better patient data acquisition and improved design of nanomaterials 
for precision cancer medicine. Diagnostic nanomaterials are used to assemble a 
patient-specific disease profile, which is then leveraged, through a set of 
therapeutic nanotechnologies, to improve the treatment outcome. However, high 
intratumor and interpatient heterogeneities make the rational design of 
diagnostic and therapeutic platforms, and analysis of their output, extremely 
difficult. Integration of AI approaches can bridge this gap, using pattern 
analysis and classification algorithms for improved diagnostic and therapeutic 
accuracy. Nanomedicine design also benefits from the application of AI, by 
optimizing material properties according to predicted interactions with the 
target drug, biological fluids, immune system, vasculature, and cell membranes, 
all affecting therapeutic efficacy. Here, fundamental concepts in AI are 
described and the contributions and promise of nanotechnology coupled with AI to 
the future of precision cancer medicine are reviewed.

INTRODUCTION: Big-data-driven drug development resources and methodologies have 
been evolving with ever-expanding data from large-scale biological experiments, 
clinical trials, and medical records from participants in data collection 
initiatives. The enrichment of biological- and clinical-context-specific 
large-scale data has enabled computational inference more relevant to real-world 
biomedical research, particularly identification of therapeutic targets and 
drugs for specific diseases and clinical scenarios.
AREAS COVERED: Here we overview recent progresses made in the fields: new 
big-data-driven approach to therapeutic target discovery, candidate drug 
prioritization, inference of clinical toxicity, and machine-learning methods in 
drug discovery.
EXPERT OPINION: In the near future, much larger volumes and complex datasets for 
precision medicine will be generated, e.g., individual and longitudinal 
multi-omic, and direct-to-consumer datasets. Closer collaborations between 
experts with different backgrounds would also be required to better translate 
analytic results into prognosis and treatment in the clinical practice. 
Meanwhile, cloud computing with protected patient privacy would become more 
routine analytic practice to fill the gaps within data integration along with 
the advent of big-data. To conclude, integration of multitudes of data generated 
for each individual along with techniques tailored for big-data analytics may 
eventually enable us to achieve precision medicine.

Many complex diseases such as cancer are associated with multiple pathological 
manifestations. Moreover, the therapeutics for their treatments often lead to 
serious side effects. Thus, it is needed to develop multi-indication 
therapeutics that can simultaneously target multiple clinical indications of 
interest and mitigate the side effects. However, conventional one-drug-one-gene 
drug discovery paradigm and emerging polypharmacology approach rarely tackle the 
challenge of multi-indication drug design. For the first time, we propose a 
one-drug-multi-target-multi-indication strategy. We develop a novel structural 
systems pharmacology platform 3D-REMAP that uses ligand binding site comparison 
and protein-ligand docking to augment sparse chemical genomics data for the 
machine learning model of genome-scale chemical-protein interaction prediction. 
Experimentally validated predictions systematically show that 3D-REMAP 
outperforms state-of-the-art ligand-based, receptor-based, and machine learning 
methods alone. As a proof-of-concept, we utilize the concept of drug repurposing 
that is enabled by 3D-REMAP to design dual-indication anti-cancer therapy. The 
repurposed drug can demonstrate anti-cancer activity for cancers that do not 
have effective treatment as well as reduce the risk of heart failure that is 
associated with all types of existing anti-cancer therapies. We predict that 
levosimendan, a PDE inhibitor for heart failure, inhibits 
serine/threonine-protein kinase RIOK1 and other kinases. Subsequent experiments 
and systems biology analyses confirm this prediction, and suggest that 
levosimendan is active against multiple cancers, notably lymphoma, through the 
direct inhibition of RIOK1 and RNA processing pathway. We further develop 
machine learning models to predict cancer cell-line's and a patient's response 
to levosimendan. Our findings suggest that levosimendan can be a promising novel 
lead compound for the development of safe, effective, and precision 
multi-indication anti-cancer therapy. This study demonstrates the potential of 
structural systems pharmacology in designing polypharmacology for precision 
medicine. It may facilitate transforming the conventional 
one-drug-one-gene-one-disease drug discovery process and single-indication 
polypharmacology approach into a new one-drug-multi-target-multi-indication 
paradigm for complex diseases.

Over the last decade, there has been considerable interest in the 
individualisation of athlete training, including the use of genetic information, 
alongside more advanced data capture and analysis techniques. Here, we explore 
the evidence for, and practical use of, a number of these emerging technologies, 
including the measurement and quantification of epigenetic changes, microbiome 
analysis and the use of cell-free DNA, along with data mining and machine 
learning. In doing so, we develop a theoretical model for the use of these 
technologies in an elite sport setting, allowing the coach to better answer six 
key questions: (1) To what training will my athlete best respond? (2) How well 
is my athlete adapting to training? (3) When should I change the training 
stimulus (i.e., has the athlete reached their adaptive ceiling for this training 
modality)? (4) How long will it take for a certain adaptation to occur? (5) How 
well is my athlete tolerating the current training load? (6) What load can my 
athlete handle today? Special consideration is given to whether such an 
individualised training framework will outperform current methods as well as the 
challenges in implementing this approach.

Precision medicine, or the individualization of evidence-based medicine, is 
forthcoming. As surgeons, we must be prepared for the integration of patient and 
system factors. Plastic surgeons regard themselves as innovators and early 
adopters. As such, we need our adaptability now more than ever to implement 
digital advancements and precision medicine into our practices. The integration 
of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and the capture of big data 
techniques should foster the next great leaps in medicine and surgery, allowing 
us to capture the detailed minutiae of precision medicine. The algorithmic 
process of artificial neural networks will guide large-scale analysis of data, 
including features such as pattern recognition and rapid quantification, to 
organize and distribute data to surgeons seamlessly. This vast digital 
collection of information, commonly termed "big data," is only one potential 
application of AI. By incorporating big data, the cognitive abilities of a 
surgeon can be complemented by the computer to improve patient-centered care. 
Furthermore, the use of AI will provide individual patients with increased 
access to the broadening world of precision medicine. Therefore, plastic 
surgeons must learn how to use AI within the contexts of our practices to keep 
up with an evolving field in medicine. Although rudimentary in its practice, we 
present a glimpse of the potential applications of AI in plastic surgery to 
incorporate the practice of precision medicine into the care that we deliver.

OBJECTIVE: Machine learning techniques have demonstrated superior discrimination 
compared to conventional statistical approaches in predicting trauma death. The 
objective of this study is to evaluate whether machine learning algorithms can 
be used to assess risk and dynamically identify patient-specific modifiable 
factors critical to patient trajectory for multiple key outcomes after severe 
injury.
METHODS: SuperLearner, an ensemble machine-learning algorithm, was applied to 
prospective observational cohort data from 1494 critically-injured patients. 
Over 1000 agnostic predictors were used to generate prediction models from 
multiple candidate learners for outcomes of interest at serial time points 
post-injury. Model accuracy was estimated using cross-validation and area under 
the curve was compared to select among predictors. Clinical variables 
responsible for driving outcomes were estimated at each time point.
RESULTS: SuperLearner fits demonstrated excellent cross-validated prediction of 
death (overall AUC 0.94-0.97), multi-organ failure (overall AUC 0.84-0.90), and 
transfusion (overall AUC 0.87-0.9) across multiple post-injury time points, and 
good prediction of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (overall AUC 0.84-0.89) 
and venous thromboembolism (overall AUC 0.73-0.83). Outcomes with inferior data 
quality included coagulopathic trajectory (AUC 0.48-0.88). Key clinical 
predictors evolved over the post-injury timecourse and included both anticipated 
and unexpected variables. Non-random missingness of data was identified as a 
predictor of multiple outcomes over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms can be used to generate dynamic 
prediction after injury while avoiding the risk of over- and under-fitting 
inherent in ad hoc statistical approaches. SuperLearner prediction after injury 
demonstrates promise as an adaptable means of helping clinicians integrate 
voluminous, evolving data on severely-injured patients into real-time, dynamic 
decision-making support.

Up to 25% of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presents during childhood, often 
with severe and extensive disease, leading to significant morbidity including 
delayed growth and nutritional impairment. The classical approach to management 
has centred on differentiation into Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis 
(UC), with subsequent treatment based on symptoms, results and complications. 
However, IBD is a heterogeneous condition with substantial variation in 
phenotype, disease course and outcome, so whilst effective treatment exists one 
size does not fit all. The ability to predict disease course at diagnosis, 
alongside tailoring medications based on response gives the potential for a more 
'personalised approach'. The move to a pre-emptive strategy to prevent 
IBD-related complications, whilst simultaneously minimising side effects and 
long-term toxicity from therapy, particularly in those with relatively indolent 
disease, has the potential to revolutionise care. In very early-onset IBD, 
personalised approaches to diagnosis and management have become the standard of 
treatment enabling clinicians to significantly alter the outcomes of the few 
children with monogenic disease. However, the promise of discoveries in 
genomics, microbiome and transcriptomics in paediatric IBD has not yet 
translated to clinical application for the vast majority of patients. Despite 
this, the opportunity presents itself to apply data gathered at diagnosis and 
follow-up to predict which patients are likely to progress to complicated 
disease, which will respond well and which will require additional therapy. 
Using complex mathematics and innovative, cutting-edge machine learning (ML) 
techniques gives the potential to use this data to develop personalised clinical 
care algorithms to treat patients more effectively, reduce toxicity and improve 
outcome. In this review, we will consider current management of paediatric IBD, 
discuss how precision medicine is making inroads into clinical practice already, 
examine the contemporary studies applying data to stratify patients and explore 
how future management may be revolutionised by personalisation with clinical, 
genomic and other multi-omic data.

Intelligence has been considered as the major challenge in promoting economic 
potential and production efficiency of precision agriculture. In order to apply 
advanced deep-learning technology to complete various agricultural tasks in 
online and offline ways, a large number of crop vision datasets with 
domain-specific annotation are urgently needed. To encourage further progress in 
challenging realistic agricultural conditions, we present the CropDeep species 
classification and detection dataset, consisting of 31,147 images with over 
49,000 annotated instances from 31 different classes. In contrast to existing 
vision datasets, images were collected with different cameras and equipment in 
greenhouses, captured in a wide variety of situations. It features visually 
similar species and periodic changes with more representative annotations, which 
have supported a stronger benchmark for deep-learning-based classification and 
detection. To further verify the application prospect, we provide extensive 
baseline experiments using state-of-the-art deep-learning classification and 
detection models. Results show that current deep-learning-based methods achieve 
well performance in classification accuracy over 99%. While current 
deep-learning methods achieve only 92% detection accuracy, illustrating the 
difficulty of the dataset and improvement room of state-of-the-art deep-learning 
models when applied to crops production and management. Specifically, we suggest 
that the YOLOv3 network has good potential application in agricultural detection 
tasks.

Personalized health research depends on aggregated sets of personal data from 
millions of people. Given that personal data can be copied, individuals are 
entitled to copies of their data and individuals are the ultimate aggregators of 
all their personal data, citizens are elevated to new roles at the center of 
health research and a novel personal data economy. There, citizens, not some 
multinational company, control the use of and benefit from the intellectual and 
economic value of these data. Here, I show that democratically controlled 
nonprofit personal data cooperatives provide a governance and trust framework 
for data sharing and data donation. They also provide a means of attaining 
improved precision health and a digital society in which socio-economic 
asymmetries can be balanced.

BACKGROUND: Nowadays, trendy research in biomedical sciences juxtaposes the term 
'precision' to medicine and public health with companion words like big data, 
data science, and deep learning. Technological advancements permit the 
collection and merging of large heterogeneous datasets from different sources, 
from genome sequences to social media posts or from electronic health records to 
wearables. Additionally, complex algorithms supported by high-performance 
computing allow one to transform these large datasets into knowledge. Despite 
such progress, many barriers still exist against achieving precision medicine 
and precision public health interventions for the benefit of the individual and 
the population.
MAIN BODY: The present work focuses on analyzing both the technical and societal 
hurdles related to the development of prediction models of health risks, 
diagnoses and outcomes from integrated biomedical databases. Methodological 
challenges that need to be addressed include improving semantics of study 
designs: medical record data are inherently biased, and even the most advanced 
deep learning's denoising autoencoders cannot overcome the bias if not handled a 
priori by design. Societal challenges to face include evaluation of ethically 
actionable risk factors at the individual and population level; for instance, 
usage of gender, race, or ethnicity as risk modifiers, not as biological 
variables, could be replaced by modifiable environmental proxies such as 
lifestyle and dietary habits, household income, or access to educational 
resources.
CONCLUSIONS: Data science for precision medicine and public health warrants an 
informatics-oriented formalization of the study design and interoperability 
throughout all levels of the knowledge inference process, from the research 
semantics, to model development, and ultimately to implementation.

Psychopathology is the scientific exploration of abnormal mental states that, 
for more than a century, has provided a Gestalt for psychiatric disorders and 
guided clinical as well as scientific progress in modern psychiatry. In the wake 
of the immense technical advances, however, psychopathology has been 
increasingly marginalized by neurobiological, genetic, and neuropsychological 
research. This ongoing erosion of psychiatric phenomenology is further fostered 
by clinical casualness as well as pressured health care and research systems. 
The skill to precisely and carefully assess psychopathology in a qualified 
manner used to be a core attribute of mental health professionals, but today's 
curricula pay increasingly less attention to its training, thus blurring the 
border between pathology and variants of the "normal" further. Despite all 
prophecies that psychopathology was doomed, and with neurobiological parameters 
having yet to show their differential-diagnostic superiority and value for 
differential indication, psychiatric diagnosis continues to rely exclusively on 
psychopathology in DSM-5 and ICD-11. Their categorical systematic, however, is 
equally challenged, and, supported by advances in machine learning, a 
personalized symptom-based approach to precision psychiatry is increasingly 
advocated. The current paper reviews the objectives of psychopathology and the 
recent debate on the role of psychopathology in future precision psychiatry-from 
guiding neurobiological research by relating neurobiological changes to 
patients' experiences to giving a framework to the psychiatric encounter. It 
concludes that contemporary research and clinic in psychiatry do not need less 
but rather more differentiated psychopathologic approaches in order to develop 
approaches that integrate professional knowledge and patients' experience.

A plethora of sensors and information technologies with applications to the 
precision nutrition of herbivores have been developed and continue to be 
developed. The nutritional processes start outside of the animal body with the 
available feed (quantity and quality) and continue inside it once the feed is 
consumed, degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and metabolised by organs and 
tissues. Finally, some nutrients are wasted via urination, defecation and 
gaseous emissions through breathing and belching whereas remaining nutrients 
ensure maintenance and production. Nowadays, several processes can be monitored 
in real-time using new technologies, but although these provide valuable data 
'as is', further gains could be obtained using this information as inputs to 
nutrition simulation models to predict unmeasurable variables in real-time and 
to forecast outcomes of interest. Data provided by sensors can create synergies 
with simulation models and this approach has the potential to expand current 
applications. In addition, data provided by sensors could be used with advanced 
analytical techniques such as data fusion, optimisation techniques and machine 
learning to improve their value for applications in precision animal nutrition. 
The present paper reviews technologies that can monitor different nutritional 
processes relevant to animal production, profitability, environmental management 
and welfare. We discussed the model-data fusion approach in which data provided 
by sensor technologies can be used as input of nutrition simulation models in 
near-real time to produce more accurate, certain and timely predictions. We also 
discuss some examples that have taken this model-data fusion approach to 
complement the capabilities of both models and sensor data, and provided 
examples such as predicting feed intake and methane emissions. Challenges with 
automatising the nutritional management of individual animals include monitoring 
and predicting of the flow of nutrients including nutrient intake, quantity and 
composition of body growth and milk production, gestation, maintenance and 
physical activities at the individual animal level. We concluded that the 
livestock industries are already seeing benefits from the development of sensor 
and information technologies, and this benefit is expected to grow exponentially 
soon with the integration of nutrition simulation models and techniques for big 
data analysis. However, this approach may need re-evaluating or performing new 
empirical research in both fields of animal nutrition and simulation modelling 
to accommodate a new type of data provided by the sensor technologies.

Current clinical diagnosis is typically based on a combination of approaches 
including clinical examination of the patient, clinical experience, physiologic 
and/or genetic parameters, high-tech diagnostic medical imaging, and an extended 
list of laboratory values mostly determined in biofluids such as blood and 
urine. One could consider this as precision medicine v1.0. However, recent 
advances in technology and better understanding of molecular mechanisms 
underlying disease will allow us to better characterize patients in the future. 
These improvements will enable us to distinguish patients who have similar 
clinical presentations but different cellular and molecular responses. 
Treatments will be able to be chosen more "precisely", resulting in more 
appropriate therapy, precision medicine v2.0. In this review, we will reflect on 
the potential added value of recent advances in technology and a better 
molecular understanding of necrosis and inflammation for improving diagnosis and 
treatment of critically ill patients. We give a brief overview on the mutual 
interplay between necrosis and inflammation, which are two crucial detrimental 
factors in organ and/or systemic dysfunction. One of the challenges for the 
future will thus be the cellular and molecular profiling of necroinflammation in 
biofluids. The huge amount of data generated by profiling biomolecules and 
single cells through, for example, different omic-approaches is needed for data 
mining methods to allow patient-clustering and identify novel biomarkers. The 
real-time monitoring of biomarkers will allow continuous (re)evaluation of 
treatment strategies using machine learning models. Ultimately, we may be able 
to offer precision therapies specifically designed to target the molecular 
set-up of an individual patient, as has begun to be done in cancer therapeutics.

Modern medicine is in the midst of a revolution driven by "big data," rapidly 
advancing computing power, and broader integration of technology into 
healthcare. Highly detailed and individualized profiles of both health and 
disease states are now possible, including biomarkers, genomic profiles, 
cognitive and behavioral phenotypes, high-frequency assessments, and medical 
imaging. Although these data are incredibly complex, they can potentially be 
used to understand multi-determinant causal relationships, elucidate modifiable 
factors, and ultimately customize treatments based on individual parameters. 
Especially for neurodegenerative diseases, where an effective therapeutic agent 
has yet to be discovered, there remains a critical need for an interdisciplinary 
perspective on data and information management due to the number of unanswered 
questions. Biomedical informatics is a multidisciplinary field that falls at the 
intersection of information technology, computer and data science, engineering, 
and healthcare that will be instrumental for uncovering novel insights into 
neurodegenerative disease research, including both causal relationships and 
therapeutic targets and maximizing the utility of both clinical and research 
data. The present study aims to provide a brief overview of biomedical 
informatics and how clinical data applications such as clinical decision support 
tools can be developed to derive new knowledge from the wealth of available data 
to advance clinical care and scientific research of neurodegenerative diseases 
in the era of precision medicine.

　Toxicity prediction based on stem cells and tissue derived from stem cells 
plays a very important role in the fields of biomedicine and pharmacology. Here 
we report on qRT-PCR data obtained by exposing 20 compounds to human embryonic 
stem (ES) cells. The data are intended to improve toxicity prediction, per 
category, of various compounds through the use of support vector machines, and 
by applying gene networks. The accuracy of our system was 97.5-100% in three 
toxicity categories: neurotoxins (NTs), genotoxic carcinogens (GCs), and 
non-genotoxic carcinogens (NGCs). We predicted that two uncategorized compounds 
(bisphenol-A and permethrin) should be classified as follows: bisphenol-A as a 
non-genotoxic carcinogen, and permethrin as a neurotoxin. These predictions are 
supported by recent reports, and as such constitute a good outcome. Our results 
include two important features: 1) The accuracy of prediction was higher when 
machine learning was carried out using gene networks and activity, rather than 
the normal quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR); and 2) By using 
undifferentiated ES cells, the late effect of chemical substances was predicted. 
From these results, we succeeded in constructing a highly effective and highly 
accurate system to predict the toxicity of compounds using stem cells.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common and disabling psychiatric condition with a 
severe socioeconomic impact. BD is treated with mood stabilizers, among which 
lithium represents the first-line treatment. Lithium alone or in combination is 
effective in 60% of chronically treated patients, but response 
remains heterogenous and a large number of patients require a change in therapy 
after several weeks or months. Many studies have so far tried to identify 
molecular and genetic markers that could help us to predict response to mood 
stabilizers or the risk for adverse drug reactions. Pharmacogenetic studies in 
BD have been for the most part focused on lithium, but the complexity and 
variability of the response phenotype, together with the unclear mechanism of 
action of lithium, limited the power of these studies to identify robust 
biomarkers. Recent pharmacogenomic studies on lithium response have provided 
promising findings, suggesting that the integration of genome-wide 
investigations with deep phenotyping, in silico analyses and machine learning 
could lead us closer to personalized treatments for BD. Nevertheless, to date 
none of the genes suggested by pharmacogenetic studies on mood stabilizers have 
been included in any of the genetic tests approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for drug efficacy. On the other hand, genetic information 
has been included in drug labels to test for the safety of carbamazepine and 
valproate. In this review, we will outline available studies investigating the 
pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics of lithium and other mood stabilizers, 
with a specific focus on the limitations of these studies and potential 
strategies to overcome them. We will also discuss FDA-approved pharmacogenetic 
tests for treatments commonly used in the management of BD.

Response heterogeneity: Challenges for personalised medicine and big data

Response rates to available treatments for psychological and chronic pain 
disorders are poor, and there is a substantial burden of suffering and 
disability for patients, who often cycle through several rounds of ineffective 
treatment. As individuals presenting to the clinic with symptoms of these 
disorders are likely to be heterogeneous, there is considerable interest in the 
possibility that different constellations of signs could be used to identify 
subgroups of patients that might preferentially benefit from particular kinds of 
treatment. To this end, there has been a recent focus on the application of 
machine learning methods to attempt to identify sets of predictor variables 
(demographic, genetic, etc.) that could be used to target individuals towards 
treatments that are more likely to work for them in the first instance. 
Importantly, the training of such models generally relies on datasets where 
groups of individual predictor variables are labelled with a binary outcome 
category - usually 'responder' or 'non-responder' (to a particular treatment). 
However, as previously highlighted in other areas of medicine, there is a basic 
statistical problem in classifying individuals as 'responding' to a particular 
treatment on the basis of data from conventional randomized controlled trials. 
Specifically, insufficient information on the partition of variance components 
in individual symptom changes mean that it is inappropriate to consider data 
from the active treatment arm alone in this way. This may be particularly 
problematic in the case of psychiatric and chronic pain symptom data, where both 
within-subject variability and measurement error are likely to be high. Here, we 
outline some possible solutions to this problem in terms of dataset design and 
machine learning methodology, and conclude that it is important to carefully 
consider the kind of inferences that particular training data are able to 
afford, especially in arenas where the potential clinical benefit is so large.

Integrating the open science movement with impactful discoveries in science, 
velocity of technology, and raw power of cloud computing has led to an 
unprecedented opportunity for scientific discovery. The American Heart 
Association recently established the Precision Medicine Platform through the 
efforts of multiple American Heart Association volunteers and a collaboration 
with Amazon Web Services. The cloud-based platform, powered by Amazon Web 
Services and available at https://precision.heart.org, was founded on the FAIR 
principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) and includes 
secure collaboration areas (workspaces) and an open sharing area. The goals of 
the platform are to democratize data, to make it easy to search across 
orthogonal data sets, to provide a secure workspace to leverage the power of 
cloud computing, and to provide a forum for users to share insights. Multiple 
learning tools are available, including video tutorials, templates using open 
interactive programming framework, and a forum for interaction among community 
members.

Psychobiological research has generated a tremendous amount of findings on the 
psychological, neuroendocrine, molecular and environmental processes that are 
directly relevant for mental and physical health, but have overwhelmed our 
capacity to meaningfully absorb, integrate, and utilize this knowledge base. 
Here, we reflect about suitable strategies to improve the translational success 
of psychoneuroendocrinological research in the era of precision medicine. 
Following a strategy advocated by the National Research Council and the 
tradition of endophenotype-based research, we advance here a new approach, 
termed "conceptual endophenotypes". We define the contextual and formal criteria 
of conceptual endophenotypes, outline criteria for filtering and selecting 
information, and describe how conceptual endophenotypes can be validated and 
implemented at the bedside. As proof-of-concept, we describe some of our 
findings from research that has adopted this approach in the context of 
stress-related disorders. We argue that conceptual endophenotypes engineer a 
bridge between the bench and the bedside. This approach readily lends itself to 
being continuously developed and implemented. Recent methodological advances, 
including digital phenotyping, machine learning, grassroots collaboration, and a 
learning healthcare system, may accelerate the development and implementation of 
this conceptual endophenotype approach.

Cancers that appear pathologically similar often respond differently to the same 
drug regimens. Methods to better match patients to drugs are in high demand. We 
demonstrate a promising approach to identify robust molecular markers for 
targeted treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by introducing: data from 30 
AML patients including genome-wide gene expression profiles and in vitro 
sensitivity to 160 chemotherapy drugs, a computational method to identify 
reliable gene expression markers for drug sensitivity by incorporating 
multi-omic prior information relevant to each gene's potential to drive cancer. 
We show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in 
identifying molecular markers replicated in validation data and predicting drug 
sensitivity accurately. Finally, we identify SMARCA4 as a marker and driver of 
sensitivity to topoisomerase II inhibitors, mitoxantrone, and etoposide, in AML 
by showing that cell lines transduced to have high SMARCA4 expression reveal 
dramatically increased sensitivity to these agents.

Dividing patients into similar groups plays a significant role in implementing 
personalized care. Clinicians and researchers have been applying patient 
grouping techniques in disease phenotyping, risk stratification, and 
personalized medicine. However, the current approaches are either based on pure 
domain knowledge where the underlying patient similarity cannot be precisely 
quantified, or based on unsupervised clustering techniques which completely 
ignore the clinical context of measuring patient similarity. In the study, we 
propose an outcome-driven approach to identify clinically similar patients which 
are grouped together as a precision cohort. The approach quantitatively measures 
the similarity between patients in terms of a particular clinical outcome of 
interest, thus patients who have a similar clinical outcome tend to be grouped 
into the same group. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in a 
real-world case study: from an atrial fibrillation patient cohort that is 
usually considered to be at high risk for ischemic stroke (IS), according to 
current clinical guidelines. Our approach successfully identified a precision 
cohort of patients with truly low risk of IS.

Melanoma will affect an estimated 73,000 new cases this year and result in 9,000 
deaths, yet precise diagnosis remains a serious problem. Without early detection 
and preventative care, melanoma can quickly spread to become fatal (Stage IV 
5-year survival rate is 20-10%) from a once localized skin lesion (Stage IA 5- 
year survival rate is 97%). There is no biomarker for melanoma in clinical use, 
and the current diagnostic criteria for skin lesions remains subjective and 
imprecise. Accurate diagnosis of melanoma relies on a histopathologic gold 
standard; thus, aggressive excision of melanocytic skin lesions has been the 
mainstay of treatment. It is estimated that 36 biopsies are performed for every 
melanoma confirmed by pathology among excised lesions. There is significant 
morbidity in misdiagnosing melanoma such as progression of the disease for a 
false negative prediction vs the risks of unnecessary surgery for a false 
positive prediction. Every year, poor diagnostic precision adds an estimated 
$673 million in overall cost to manage the disease. Currently, manual 
dermatoscopic imaging is the standard of care in selecting atypical skin lesions 
for biopsy, and at best it achieves 90% sensitivity but only 59% specificity 
when performed by an expert dermatologist. Many computer vision (CV) algorithms 
perform better than dermatologists in classifying skin lesions although not 
significantly so in clinical practice. Meanwhile, open source deep learning (DL) 
techniques in CV have been gaining dominance since 2012 for image 
classification, and today DL can outperform humans in classifying millions of 
digital images with less than 5% error rates. Moreover, DL algorithms are 
readily run on commoditized hardware and have a strong online community of 
developers supporting their rapid adoption. In this work, we performed a 
successful pilot study to show proof of concept to DL skin pathology from 
images. However, DL algorithms must be trained on very large labelled datasets 
of images to achieve high accuracy. Here, we begin to assemble a large imageset 
of skin lesions from the UCSF and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center (VAMC) dermatology clinics that are well characterized by their 
underlying pathology, on which to train DL algorithms. If trained on sufficient 
data, we hypothesize that our approach will significantly outperform general 
dermatologists in predicting skin lesion pathology. We posit that our work will 
allow for precision diagnosis of melanoma from widely available digital 
photography, which may optimize the management of the disease by decreasing 
unnecessary office visits and the significant morbidity and cost of melanoma 
misdiagnosis.

Q-learning is a method of reinforcement learning that employs backwards 
stagewise estimation to identify sequences of actions that maximize some 
long-term reward. The method can be applied to sequential multiple-assignment 
randomized trials to develop personalized adaptive treatment strategies 
(ATSs)-longitudinal practice guidelines highly tailored to time-varying 
attributes of individual patients. Sometimes, the basis for choosing which ATSs 
to include in a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial (or randomized 
controlled trial) may be inadequate. Nonrandomized data sources may inform the 
initial design of ATSs, which could later be prospectively validated. In this 
paper, we illustrate challenges involved in using nonrandomized data for this 
purpose with a case study from the Center for International Blood and Marrow 
Transplant Research registry (1995-2007) aimed at 1) determining whether the 
sequence of therapeutic classes used in graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis 
and in refractory graft-versus-host disease is associated with improved survival 
and 2) identifying donor and patient factors with which to guide individualized 
immunosuppressant selections over time. We discuss how to communicate the 
potential benefit derived from following an ATS at the population and subgroup 
levels and how to evaluate its robustness to modeling assumptions. This worked 
example may serve as a model for developing ATSs from registries and cohorts in 
oncology and other fields requiring sequential treatment decisions.

The practice of precision medicine will ultimately require databases of genes 
and mutations for healthcare providers to reference in order to understand the 
clinical implications of each patient's genetic makeup. Although the highest 
quality databases require manual curation, text mining tools can facilitate the 
curation process, increasing accuracy, coverage, and productivity. However, to 
date there are no available text mining tools that offer high-accuracy 
performance for extracting such triplets from biomedical literature. In this 
paper we propose a high-performance machine learning approach to automate the 
extraction of disease-gene-variant triplets from biomedical literature. Our 
approach is unique because we identify the genes and protein products associated 
with each mutation from not just the local text content, but from a global 
context as well (from the Internet and from all literature in PubMed). Our 
approach also incorporates protein sequence validation and disease association 
using a novel text-mining-based machine learning approach. We extract 
disease-gene-variant triplets from all abstracts in PubMed related to a set of 
ten important diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung 
cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, Alzheimer's disease, hemochromatosis, 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetes mellitus, and cystic fibrosis). 
We then evaluate our approach in two ways: (1) a direct comparison with the 
state of the art using benchmark datasets; (2) a validation study comparing the 
results of our approach with entries in a popular human-curated database 
(UniProt) for each of the previously mentioned diseases. In the benchmark 
comparison, our full approach achieves a 28% improvement in F1-measure (from 
0.62 to 0.79) over the state-of-the-art results. For the validation study with 
UniProt Knowledgebase (KB), we present a thorough analysis of the results and 
errors. Across all diseases, our approach returned 272 triplets 
(disease-gene-variant) that overlapped with entries in UniProt and 5,384 
triplets without overlap in UniProt. Analysis of the overlapping triplets and of 
a stratified sample of the non-overlapping triplets revealed accuracies of 93% 
and 80% for the respective categories (cumulative accuracy, 77%). We conclude 
that our process represents an important and broadly applicable improvement to 
the state of the art for curation of disease-gene-variant relationships.

OBJECTIVE: Identifying disease-mutation relationships is a significant challenge 
in the advancement of precision medicine. The aim of this work is to design a 
tool that automates the extraction of disease-related mutations from biomedical 
text to advance database curation for the support of precision medicine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a machine-learning (ML) based method to 
automatically identify the mutations mentioned in the biomedical literature 
related to a particular disease. In order to predict a relationship between the 
mutation and the target disease, several features, such as statistical features, 
distance features, and sentiment features, were constructed. Our ML model was 
trained with a pre-labeled dataset consisting of manually curated information 
about mutation-disease associations. The model was subsequently used to extract 
disease-related mutations from larger biomedical literature corpora.
RESULTS: The performance of the proposed approach was assessed using a 
benchmarking dataset. Results show that our proposed approach gains significant 
improvement over the previous state of the art and obtains F-measures of 0.880 
and 0.845 for prostate and breast cancer mutations, respectively.
DISCUSSION: To demonstrate its utility, we applied our approach to all abstracts 
in PubMed for 3 diseases (including a non-cancer disease). The mutations 
extracted were then manually validated against human-curated databases. The 
validation results show that the proposed approach is useful in a real-world 
setting to extract uncurated disease mutations from the biomedical literature.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach improves the state of the art for 
mutation-disease extraction from text. It is scalable and generalizable to 
identify mutations for any disease at a PubMed scale.

According to Cancer Research UK, cancer is a leading cause of death accounting 
for more than one in four of all deaths in 2011. The recent advances in 
experimental technologies in cancer research have resulted in the accumulation 
of large amounts of patient-specific datasets, which provide complementary 
information on the same cancer type. We introduce a versatile data fusion 
(integration) framework that can effectively integrate somatic mutation data, 
molecular interactions and drug chemical data to address three key challenges in 
cancer research: stratification of patients into groups having different 
clinical outcomes, prediction of driver genes whose mutations trigger the onset 
and development of cancers, and repurposing of drugs treating particular cancer 
patient groups. Our new framework is based on graph-regularised non-negative 
matrix tri-factorization, a machine learning technique for co-clustering 
heterogeneous datasets. We apply our framework on ovarian cancer data to 
simultaneously cluster patients, genes and drugs by utilising all datasets.We 
demonstrate superior performance of our method over the state-of-the-art method, 
Network-based Stratification, in identifying three patient subgroups that have 
significant differences in survival outcomes and that are in good agreement with 
other clinical data. Also, we identify potential new driver genes that we obtain 
by analysing the gene clusters enriched in known drivers of ovarian cancer 
progression. We validated the top scoring genes identified as new drivers 
through database search and biomedical literature curation. Finally, we identify 
potential candidate drugs for repurposing that could be used in treatment of the 
identified patient subgroups by targeting their mutated gene products. We 
validated a large percentage of our drug-target predictions by using other 
databases and through literature curation.

As research laboratories and clinics collaborate to achieve precision medicine, 
both communities are required to understand mandated electronic health/medical 
record (EHR/EMR) initiatives that will be fully implemented in all clinics in 
the United States by 2015. Stakeholders will need to evaluate current record 
keeping practices and optimize and standardize methodologies to capture nearly 
all information in digital format. Collaborative efforts from academic and 
industry sectors are crucial to achieving higher efficacy in patient care while 
minimizing costs. Currently existing digitized data and information are present 
in multiple formats and are largely unstructured. In the absence of a 
universally accepted management system, departments and institutions continue to 
generate silos of information. As a result, invaluable and newly discovered 
knowledge is difficult to access. To accelerate biomedical research and reduce 
healthcare costs, clinical and bioinformatics systems must employ common data 
elements to create structured annotation forms enabling laboratories and clinics 
to capture sharable data in real time. Conversion of these datasets to knowable 
information should be a routine institutionalized process. New scientific 
knowledge and clinical discoveries can be shared via integrated knowledge 
environments defined by flexible data models and extensive use of standards, 
ontologies, vocabularies, and thesauri. In the clinical setting, aggregated 
knowledge must be displayed in user-friendly formats so that physicians, 
non-technical laboratory personnel, nurses, data/research coordinators, and 
end-users can enter data, access information, and understand the output. The 
effort to connect astronomical numbers of data points, including '-omics'-based 
molecular data, individual genome sequences, experimental data, patient clinical 
phenotypes, and follow-up data is a monumental task. Roadblocks to this vision 
of integration and interoperability include ethical, legal, and logistical 
concerns. Ensuring data security and protection of patient rights while 
simultaneously facilitating standardization is paramount to maintaining public 
support. The capabilities of supercomputing need to be applied strategically. A 
standardized, methodological implementation must be applied to developed 
artificial intelligence systems with the ability to integrate data and 
information into clinically relevant knowledge. Ultimately, the integration of 
bioinformatics and clinical data in a clinical decision support system promises 
precision medicine and cost effective and personalized patient care.

OBJECTIVE: One of the hardest technical tasks in employing Bayesian network 
models in practice is obtaining their numerical parameters. In the light of this 
difficulty, a pressing question, one that has immediate implications on the 
knowledge engineering effort, is whether precision of these parameters is 
important. In this paper, we address experimentally the question whether medical 
diagnostic systems based on Bayesian networks are sensitive to precision of 
their parameters.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The test networks include Hepar II, a sizeable Bayesian 
network model for diagnosis of liver disorders and six other medical diagnostic 
networks constructed from medical data sets available through the Irvine Machine 
Learning Repository. Assuming that the original model parameters are perfectly 
accurate, we lower systematically their precision by rounding them to 
progressively courser scales and check the impact of this rounding on the 
models' accuracy.
RESULTS: Our main result, consistent across all tested networks, is that 
imprecision in numerical parameters has minimal impact on the diagnostic 
accuracy of models, as long as we avoid zeroes among parameters.
CONCLUSION: The experiments' results provide evidence that as long as we avoid 
zeroes among model parameters, diagnostic accuracy of Bayesian network models 
does not suffer from decreased precision of their parameters.

Conventional approaches to predict transcriptional regulatory interactions 
usually rely on the definition of a shared motif sequence on the target genes of 
a transcription factor (TF). These efforts have been frustrated by the limited 
availability and accuracy of TF binding site motifs, usually represented as 
position-specific scoring matrices, which may match large numbers of sites and 
produce an unreliable list of target genes. To improve the prediction of binding 
sites, we propose to additionally use the unrelated knowledge of the genome 
layout. Indeed, it has been shown that co-regulated genes tend to be either 
neighbors or periodically spaced along the whole chromosome. This study 
demonstrates that respective gene positioning carries significant information. 
This novel type of information is combined with traditional sequence information 
by a machine learning algorithm called PreCisIon. To optimize this combination, 
PreCisIon builds a strong gene target classifier by adaptively combining weak 
classifiers based on either local binding sequence or global gene position. This 
strategy generically paves the way to the optimized incorporation of any future 
advances in gene target prediction based on local sequence, genome layout or on 
novel criteria. With the current state of the art, PreCisIon consistently 
improves methods based on sequence information only. This is shown by 
implementing a cross-validation analysis of the 20 major TFs from two 
phylogenetically remote model organisms. For Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia 
coli, respectively, PreCisIon achieves on average an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 70 and 60%, a sensitivity of 80 and 70% and a 
specificity of 60 and 56%. The newly predicted gene targets are demonstrated to 
be functionally consistent with previously known targets, as assessed by 
analysis of Gene Ontology enrichment or of the relevant literature and 
databases.

DNA microarrays have contributed to the exponential growth of genomic and 
experimental data in the last decade. This large amount of gene expression data 
has been used by researchers seeking diagnosis of diseases like cancer using 
machine learning methods. In turn, explicit biological knowledge about gene 
functions has also grown tremendously over the last decade. This work integrates 
explicit biological knowledge, provided as gene sets, into the classication 
process by means of Variable Precision Rough Set Theory (VPRS). The proposed 
model is able to highlight which part of the provided biological knowledge has 
been important for classification. This paper presents a novel model for 
microarray data classification which is able to incorporate prior biological 
knowledge in the form of gene sets. Based on this knowledge, we transform the 
input microarray data into supergenes, and then we apply rough set theory to 
select the most promising supergenes and to derive a set of easy interpretable 
classification rules. The proposed model is evaluated over three breast cancer 
microarrays datasets obtaining successful results compared to classical 
classification techniques. The experimental results shows that there are not 
significant differences between our model and classical techniques but it is 
able to provide a biological-interpretable explanation of how it classifies new 
samples.

Imaging-based high-content screens often rely on single cell-based evaluation of 
phenotypes in large data sets of microscopic images. Traditionally, these 
screens are analyzed by extracting a few image-related parameters and use their 
ratios (linear single or multiparametric separation) to classify the cells into 
various phenotypic classes. In this study, the authors show how machine 
learning-based classification of individual cells outperforms those classical 
ratio-based techniques. Using fluorescent intensity and morphological and 
texture features, they evaluated how the performance of data analysis increases 
with increasing feature numbers. Their findings are based on a case study 
involving an siRNA screen monitoring nucleoplasmic and nucleolar accumulation of 
a fluorescently tagged reporter protein. For the analysis, they developed a 
complete analysis workflow incorporating image segmentation, feature extraction, 
cell classification, hit detection, and visualization of the results. For the 
classification task, the authors have established a new graphical framework, the 
Advanced Cell Classifier, which provides a very accurate high-content screen 
analysis with minimal user interaction, offering access to a variety of advanced 
machine learning methods.

Precision-mapping and statistical validation of quantitative trait loci by 
machine learning.

BACKGROUND: We introduce a QTL-mapping algorithm based on Statistical Machine 
Learning (SML) that is conceptually quite different to existing methods as there 
is a strong focus on generalisation ability. Our approach combines ridge 
regression, recursive feature elimination, and estimation of generalisation 
performance and marker effects using bootstrap resampling. Model performance and 
marker effects are determined using independent testing samples (individuals), 
thus providing better estimates. We compare the performance of SML against 
Composite Interval Mapping (CIM), Bayesian Interval Mapping (BIM) and single 
Marker Regression (MR) on synthetic datasets and a multi-trait and 
multi-environment dataset of the progeny for a cross between two barley 
cultivars.
RESULTS: In an analysis of the synthetic datasets, SML accurately predicted the 
number of QTL underlying a trait while BIM tended to underestimate the number of 
QTL. The QTL identified by SML for the barley dataset broadly coincided with 
known QTL locations. SML reported approximately half of the QTL reported by 
either CIM or MR, not unexpected given that neither CIM nor MR incorporates 
independent testing. The latter makes these two methods susceptible to producing 
overly optimistic estimates of QTL effects, as we demonstrate for MR. The QTL 
resolution (peak definition) afforded by SML was consistently superior to MR, 
CIM and BIM, with QTL detection power similar to BIM. The precision of SML was 
underscored by repeatedly identifying, at < or = 1-cM precision, three QTL for 
four partially related traits (heading date, plant height, lodging and yield). 
The set of QTL obtained using a 'raw' and a 'curated' version of the same 
genotypic dataset were more similar to each other for SML than for CIM or MR.
CONCLUSION: The SML algorithm produces better estimates of QTL effects because 
it eliminates the optimistic bias in the predictive performance of other QTL 
methods. It produces narrower peaks than other methods (except BIM) and hence 
identifies QTL with greater precision. It is more robust to genotyping and 
linkage mapping errors, and identifies markers linked to QTL in the absence of a 
genetic map.

OBJECTIVES: To leverage the high clinical heterogeneity of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE), we developed and validated a new stratification scheme by 
integrating genome-scale transcriptomic profiles to identify patient subtypes 
sharing similar transcriptomic markers and drug targets.
METHODS: A normalized compendium of transcription profiles was created from 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 1046 SLE patients and 86 healthy 
controls (HCs), covering an intersection of 13 689 genes from six microarray 
datasets. Upregulated differentially expressed genes were subjected to 
functional and network analysis in which samples were grouped using unsupervised 
clustering to identify patient subtypes. Then, clustering stability was 
evaluated by the stratification of six integrated RNA-sequencing datasets using 
the same method. Finally, the Xgboost classifier was applied to the independent 
datasets to identify factors associated with treatment outcomes.
RESULTS: Based on 278 upregulated DEGs of the transcript profiles, SLE patients 
were classified into three subtypes (subtype A-C) each with distinct molecular 
and cellular signatures. Neutrophil activation-related pathways were markedly 
activated in subtype A (named NE-driving), whereas lymphocyte and IFN-related 
pathways were more enriched in subtype B (IFN-driving). As the most severe 
subtype, subtype C [NE-IFN-dual-driving (Dual-driving)] shared functional 
mechanisms with both NE-driving and IFN-driving, which was closely associated 
with clinical features and could be used to predict the responses of treatment.
CONCLUSION: We developed the largest cohesive SLE transcriptomic compendium for 
deep stratification using the most comprehensive microarray and RNA sequencing 
datasets to date. This result could guide future design of molecular diagnosis 
and the development of stratified therapy for SLE patients.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can unveil novel personalized treatments based on 
drug screening and whole-exome sequencing experiments (WES). However, the 
concept of "black box" in AI limits the potential of this approach to be 
translated into the clinical practice. In contrast, explainable AI (XAI) focuses 
on making AI results understandable to humans. Here, we present a novel XAI 
method -called multi-dimensional module optimization (MOM)- that associates drug 
screening with genetic events, while guaranteeing that predictions are 
interpretable and robust. We applied MOM to an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
cohort of 319 ex-vivo tumor samples with 122 screened drugs and WES. MOM 
returned a therapeutic strategy based on the FLT3, CBFβ-MYH11, and NRAS status, 
which predicted AML patient response to Quizartinib, Trametinib, Selumetinib, 
and Crizotinib. We successfully validated the results in three different 
large-scale screening experiments. We believe that XAI will help healthcare 
providers and drug regulators better understand AI medical decisions.

There are over 6,000 different rare diseases estimated to impact 300 million 
people worldwide. As genetic testing becomes more common practice in the 
clinical setting, the number of rare disease diagnoses will continue to 
increase, resulting in the need for novel treatment options. Identifying 
treatments for these disorders is challenging due to a limited understanding of 
disease mechanisms, small cohort sizes, interindividual symptom variability, and 
little commercial incentive to develop new treatments. A promising avenue for 
treatment is drug repurposing, where FDA-approved drugs are repositioned as 
novel treatments. However, linking disease mechanisms to drug action can be 
extraordinarily difficult and requires a depth of knowledge across multiple 
fields, which is complicated by the rapid pace of biomedical knowledge 
discovery. To address these challenges, The Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine 
Institute developed an artificial intelligence tool, mediKanren, that leverages 
the mechanistic insight of genetic disorders to identify therapeutic options. 
Using knowledge graphs, mediKanren enables an efficient way to link all relevant 
literature and databases. This tool has allowed for a scalable process that has 
been used to help over 500 rare disease families. Here, we provide a description 
of our process, the advantages of mediKanren, and its impact on rare disease 
patients.

Decentralized distributed learning is the key to enabling large-scale machine 
learning (training) on the edge devices utilizing private user-generated local 
data, without relying on the cloud. However, practical realization of such 
on-device training is limited by the communication and compute bottleneck. In 
this paper, we propose and show the convergence of low precision decentralized 
training that aims to reduce the computational complexity and communication cost 
of decentralized training. Many feedback-based compression techniques have been 
proposed in the literature to reduce communication costs. To the best of our 
knowledge, there is no work that applies and shows compute efficient training 
techniques such as quantization, pruning etc., for peer-to-peer decentralized 
learning setups. Since real-world applications have a significant skew in the 
data distribution, we design "Range-EvoNorm" as the normalization activation 
layer which is better suited for low precision training over non-IID data. 
Moreover, we show that the proposed low precision training can be used in 
synergy with other communication compression methods decreasing the 
communication cost further. Our experiments indicate that 8-bit decentralized 
training has minimal accuracy loss compared to its full precision counterpart 
even with non-IID data. However, when low precision training is accompanied by 
communication compression through sparsification we observe a 1-2% drop in 
accuracy. The proposed low precision decentralized training decreases 
computational complexity, memory usage, and communication cost by ∼4× and 
compute energy by a factor of ∼20×, while trading off less than a 1% accuracy 
for both IID and non-IID data. In particular, for higher skew values, we observe 
an increase in accuracy (by ∼0.5%) with low precision training, indicating the 
regularization effect of the quantization.

Cattle are less active than humans. Hence, it was hypothesized in this study 
that transmitting acceleration signals at a 1 min sampling interval to reduce 
storage load has the potential to improve the performance of motion sensors 
without affecting the precision of behavior classification. The behavior 
classification performance in terms of precision, sensitivity, and the F1-score 
of the 1 min serial datasets segmented in 3, 4, and 5 min window sizes based on 
nine algorithms were determined. The collar-fitted triaxial accelerometer sensor 
was attached on the right side of the neck of the two fattening Korean steers 
(age: 20 months) and the steers were observed for 6 h on day one, 10 h on day 
two, and 7 h on day three. The acceleration signals and visual observations were 
time synchronized and analyzed based on the objectives. The resting behavior was 
most correctly classified using the combination of a 4 min window size and the 
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm which resulted in 89% high precision, 
81% high sensitivity, and 85% high F1-score. High classification performance 
(79% precision, 88% sensitivity, and 83% F1-score) was also obtained in 
classifying the eating behavior using the same classification method (4 min 
window size and an LSTM algorithm). The most poorly classified behavior was the 
active behavior. This study showed that the collar-fitted triaxial sensor 
measuring 1 min serial signals could be used as a tool for detecting the resting 
and eating behaviors of cattle in high precision by segmenting the acceleration 
signals in a 4 min window size and by using the LSTM classification algorithm.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral bone disorder (MBD) is a complex clinical 
syndrome that begins early during CKD and evolves into one of the deadliest 
complications of CKD through its effects on the cardiovascular and skeletal 
systems. Achievement of treatment goals to decrease the risk of accelerated 
cardiovascular events and fractures has been challenging. We hypothesized that 
application of quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling combined with 
artificial intelligence techniques could improve the management of CKD-MBD with 
the goal of improving outcomes for patients with CKD. We present the 
implementation of a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to achieve the 
prescribed goals for serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone through 
concurrent dosing of phosphate binders, vitamin D analogs, and calcimimetics by 
simulation in 80 subjects in Matlab. In silico simulation results demonstrate 
that the application of a QSP model coupled with RL more effectively and quickly 
achieves treatment goals even in the setting of inferior simulated subject 
compliance with medical therapy and identifies key decision variables for 
therapeutic recommendations.

Breast cancers represent complex ecosystem-like networks of malignant cells and 
their associated microenvironment. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor 
(PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are biomarkers 
ubiquitous to clinical practice in evaluating prognosis and predicting response 
to therapy. Recent feats in breast cancer have led to a new digital era, and 
advanced clinical trials have resulted in a growing number of personalized 
therapies with corresponding biomarkers. In this state-of-the-art review, we 
included the latest 10-year updated recommendations for ER, PR, and HER2, along 
with the most salient information on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), 
Ki-67, PD-L1, and several prognostic/predictive biomarkers at genomic, 
transcriptomic, and proteomic levels recently developed for selection and 
optimization of breast cancer treatment. Looking forward, the multi-omic 
landscape of the tumor ecosystem could be integrated with computational findings 
from whole slide images and radiomics in predictive machine learning (ML) 
models. These are new digital ecosystems on the road to precision breast cancer 
medicine.

Cancer cells depend on multiple driver alterations whose oncogenic effects can 
be suppressed by drug combinations. Here, we provide a comprehensive resource of 
precision combination therapies tailored to oncogenic coalterations that are 
recurrent across patient cohorts. To generate the resource, we developed 
Recurrent Features Leveraged for Combination Therapy (REFLECT), which integrates 
machine learning and cancer informatics algorithms. Using multiomic data, the 
method maps recurrent coalteration signatures in patient cohorts to combination 
therapies. We validated the REFLECT pipeline using data from patient-derived 
xenografts, in vitro drug screens, and a combination therapy clinical trial. 
These validations demonstrate that REFLECT-selected combination therapies have 
significantly improved efficacy, synergy, and survival outcomes. In patient 
cohorts with immunotherapy response markers, DNA repair aberrations, and HER2 
activation, we have identified therapeutically actionable and recurrent 
coalteration signatures. REFLECT provides a resource and framework to design 
combination therapies tailored to tumor cohorts in data-driven clinical trials 
and preclinical studies.
SIGNIFICANCE: We developed the predictive bioinformatics platform REFLECT and a 
multiomics- based precision combination therapy resource. The REFLECT-selected 
therapies lead to significant improvements in efficacy and patient survival in 
preclinical and clinical settings. Use of REFLECT can optimize therapeutic 
benefit through selection of drug combinations tailored to molecular signatures 
of tumors. See related commentary by Pugh and Haibe-Kains, p. 1416. This article 
is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1397.

The following 10 to 15 years will be a key strategic period for China to improve 
national nutrition and health. As people's understanding of health and disease 
continues to deepen, health was defined as a series of signs that can maintain 
physiologically dynamic and orderly characteristics and rely on more precise 
individualized guidance or intervention measures to sustain. "Precision 
Nutrition" uses various new technologies and concepts to examine multiple 
dimensions such as nutrition intake, lifestyle, phenotype, and genotype, to 
achieve personalized and accurate nutrition interventions, and contribute to the 
achievement of health in the new era. Nowadays, it is still needed to build 
multi-omics models, develop them more accurately, conveniently. And instant 
applies technique and use artificial intelligence methods to fully integrate 
multi-dimensional datasets to provide complete solutions for implementing 
nutrition and health.

Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer. However, systematic 
characterizations of metabolites in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are 
still lacking. Our study profiled the polar metabolome and lipidome in 330 TNBC 
samples and 149 paired normal breast tissues to construct a large metabolomic 
atlas of TNBC. Combining with previously established transcriptomic and genomic 
data of the same cohort, we conducted a comprehensive analysis linking TNBC 
metabolome to genomics. Our study classified TNBCs into three distinct 
metabolomic subgroups: C1, characterized by the enrichment of ceramides and 
fatty acids; C2, featured with the upregulation of metabolites related to 
oxidation reaction and glycosyl transfer; and C3, having the lowest level of 
metabolic dysregulation. Based on this newly developed metabolomic dataset, we 
refined previous TNBC transcriptomic subtypes and identified some crucial 
subtype-specific metabolites as potential therapeutic targets. The 
transcriptomic luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype overlapped with 
metabolomic C1 subtype. Experiments on patient-derived organoid and xenograft 
models indicate that targeting sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), an intermediate of 
the ceramide pathway, is a promising therapy for LAR tumors. Moreover, the 
transcriptomic basal-like immune-suppressed (BLIS) subtype contained two 
prognostic metabolomic subgroups (C2 and C3), which could be distinguished 
through machine-learning methods. We show that N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate is a 
crucial tumor-promoting metabolite and potential therapeutic target for 
high-risk BLIS tumors. Together, our study reveals the clinical significance of 
TNBC metabolomics, which can not only optimize the transcriptomic subtyping 
system, but also suggest novel therapeutic targets. This metabolomic dataset can 
serve as a useful public resource to promote precision treatment of TNBC.

Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of death among female patients with 
cancer. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have the lowest 
survival rate. TNBC has substantial heterogeneity within the BC population. This 
study utilized our novel patient stratification and drug repositioning method to 
find subgroups of BC patients that share common genetic profiles and that may 
respond similarly to the recommended drugs. After further examination of the 
discovered patient subgroups, we identified five homogeneous druggable TNBC 
subgroups. A drug repositioning algorithm was then applied to find the drugs 
with a high potential for each subgroup. Most of the top drugs for these 
subgroups were chemotherapy used for various types of cancer, including BC. 
After analyzing the biological mechanisms targeted by these drugs, ferroptosis 
was the common cell death mechanism induced by the top drugs in the subgroups 
with neoplasm subdivision and race as clinical variables. In contrast, the 
antioxidative effect on cancer cells was the common targeted mechanism in the 
subgroup of patients with an age less than 50. Literature reviews were used to 
validate our findings, which could provide invaluable insights to streamline the 
drug repositioning process and could be further studied in a wet lab setting and 
in clinical trials.

Machine learning (ML) integrated with medical imaging has introduced new 
perspectives in precision diagnostics of high-grade gliomas, through radiomics 
and radiogenomics. This has raised hopes for characterizing noninvasive and in 
vivo biomarkers for prediction of patient survival, tumor recurrence, and 
genomics and therefore encouraging treatments tailored to individualized needs. 
Characterization of tumor infiltration based on pre-operative multi-parametric 
magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) scans may allow prediction of the loci of 
future tumor recurrence and thereby aid in planning the course of treatment for 
the patients, such as optimizing the extent of resection and the dose and target 
area of radiation. Imaging signatures of tumor genomics can help in identifying 
the patients who benefit from certain targeted therapies. Specifying molecular 
properties of gliomas and prediction of their changes over time and with 
treatment would allow optimization of treatment. In this article, we provide 
neuro-oncology, neuropathology, and computational perspectives on the promise of 
radiomics and radiogenomics for allowing personalized treatments of patients 
with gliomas and discuss the challenges and limitations of these methods in 
multi-institutional clinical trials and suggestions to mitigate the issues and 
the future directions.

Psychiatric disorders, including suicide, are complex disorders that are 
affected by many different risk factors. It has been estimated that genetic 
factors contribute up to 50% to suicide risk. As the candidate gene approach has 
not identified a gene or set of genes that can be defined as biomarkers for 
suicidal behaviour, much is expected from cutting edge technological approaches 
that can interrogate several hundred, or even millions, of biomarkers at a time. 
These include the '-omic' approaches, such as genomics, transcriptomics, 
epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Indeed, these have revealed new 
candidate biomarkers associated with suicidal behaviour. The most interesting of 
these have been implicated in inflammation and immune responses, which have been 
revealed through different study approaches, from genome-wide single nucleotide 
studies and the micro-RNA transcriptome, to the proteome and metabolome. 
However, the massive amounts of data that are generated by the '-omic' 
technologies demand the use of powerful computational analysis, and also 
specifically trained personnel. In this regard, machine learning approaches are 
beginning to pave the way towards personalized psychiatry.
